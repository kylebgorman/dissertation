@article{Hill1954,
    Annote = {444f.: Sequences of more than two vowels always contain one or more vowel extremes. In a three-vowel sequence, if the second is an extreme it assumes its consonantal shape, with syllable division before it: \emph{Auernus} /a-uernus/; the rule applies even if the first and third are also extremes: \emph{biiugis} `yoked two together' /bi-iugis/. If the second is a non-extreme vowel, first and third assume their consonantal shape without syllable division: \emph{uae} /uai/. In a four-vowel sequnce, the treatment depends primarily on the first vowel. If it is non-extreme, consonantal allophones appear for the second and third, with division between them: \emph{aeuī} /ai-uiL/ and (in spite of the spelling) \emph{maius} /mai-ius/. If the first is an extreme, consonantal allophones appear for the first and third, with division before the third: \emph{iuuō} /iu-uoL/.

One other type of vowel sequence involves no necessary juncture: a long vowel followed by another vowel. This type is always dissyllabic, the /L/ closing the first syllable as we should expect: \emph{āeris} /aL-eris/ `of the air', and \emph{dēerrō} /deL-erroL/ `I lose my way'. 

Other apparent vowel sequences contain a juncture, and contrast with those which do not. A good minimal contrast is that between \emph{aes} `brass', and \emph{ais} `thou sayest'. Phonetically the two are [áys] and [áˑǐs], the first one being one syllable and containing only one true vowel, the second being two syllables separated by a half-unit of lengthening and containing two vowels. Phonemically, the two are /ais/ and /a+is/. Other examples of sequences with juncture are \emph{deinde} /de+inde/ `thereupon', \emph{coit} /ko+it/ `it comes together', and \emph{ruit} /ru+it/ `it falls'; the rule is that two true vowels are always separated by a consonant, by length, or by a juncture.},

For example, if they work because they compute statistics (e.g., the statistics relating spelling to pronunciation, or semantic features to words), then unless one wishes to argue that the particular connectionist algorithm like back-propagation (Rummelhart, Hinton and Williams, 1986) is a true reflection of the way computation of these statistics is implemented in the brain, the underlying explanation is really that behaviour is driven by some process that computes the relevant statistics. This is by no means a trivial claim. If some particular behaviour would emerge from almost any system that computed the right statistics, this tells us something very important.

    Annote = {33: [impossible medial clusters as signaling] 
48-52: [the classics]

(1) Determine the boundaries of the sections in the utterance to be syllabized; these boundaries are automatically syllable boundaries.
(2) Divide each section provisorily in such a way that a syllable boundary occurs after every vowel, that is, that all syllables are open […]
(3) If a syllable cannot be kept open because its vowel does not occur in word-final position, then as many consonants as necessary---but no more---to provide the syllable with a permissible coda, thereby removing the vowel from the syllable-final position, must be detached from the onset of the next syllable and transferred to the preceding syllable.

51: If the necessary transfer from syllable-initial to syllbale-final position leads to an inadmissible syllable-final group of consonants, then the burden of irregularity must be borned by the coda rather than the following onset. For example, Spanish \emph{transcribir} cannot be divided \emph{tra-nscribir} or \emph{tran-scribir} since both \emph{nscr} and \emph{scr} are impossible word-initially, hence must be divided \emph{trans-cribir}, even though there nw results a non-permissible final \emph{ns}. [footnote omitted] NOTE: The contingency to create a non-permissible coda arises only rarely, and when it does it generally discloses the presence of an unassimilated loan (a category which includes also so-called learned words, which are loans from an earlier stage of the same language). Indeed Spanish \emph{transcribir} is such an item; in popular, wholly natural pronunciation is is converted into \emph{tras-cribir}, with entirely normal coda and onset.

91: \ldots{}there inevitably arises doubtful and marginal cases where one hesitates to declare categorically that a certain consonant series is or is not a genuine, native, comtemporary, structurally impeccable part of the idiom under examination. This is so because any living linguistic structure contains at its edges both the remnants of an archaic, disappearing system, and the harbingers of an inovating, arising system---and the difficulty lies in deciding where that murky region of the edges begins. 

In strictly synchronic terms, the linguist has two choices on which to base this decision. Either he considers everything that he finds in the corpus as `occurring' in teh sense that it must be included and accommodated in the system, hence it is also permissible; or he harshly excludes whatever event does not fit a unique and homogeneous structural core, and denies it genuineness, relegating it thereby to the non-permissible class\ldots{}Rigid pursuance of the first alternative leads to a complex and untidy statement that indiscriminately embraces borrowed, obsolete, and novel items, implicity of low statistical value yet assigned the same systemic value, to whose inclusion one sacrifices an achievable degree of descriptive simplicity and neatness; the second alternative tempts the scholar to seek and impose siplicity and neatness whcih such vehemence that he is beguiled into performing what I should call Procrustean surger, lopping and stretching the corpus so as to force into into a frame of scientific stringency and rigidity of the kind one associates with the natural, exact, `hard' sciences, but which in teh social and behavioral sciences, including linguistics, need not be demanded nor can always be attained without wilful mutilation of the evidence.},

    Annote = {392-393: In segmental phonology, such phenomena are pervasive. Thus the rules deriving the alternants \emph{decide}-\emph{decisive}-\emph{decision} from an invariant underlying lexical form are straightforward and natural at each step, but the relevant contexts do not appear at all in the output; given only output conditions, it is hard to see why \emph{decision}, for example, should not rhyme with \emph{Poseidon} on the simplest assumptions about lexical representations and optimal output conditions. Similarly, intervocalic spirantization and vowel reduction are natural and simple processes that derive, say, Hebrew \emph{ganvu} (``they stole'') from underlying \emph{g}-\emph{n}-\emph{B}, but the context for spirantization is gone after reduction applies; the underlying form might even all but disappear in the output, as in \emph{hitu} (``they extended''), in which only the /t/ remains from the underlying root /ntC/ (C a ``weak'' consonant). 

In all such cases, it is possible to formulate the desired result in terms of outputs. \ldots Similar artifice could be used in the phonological examples, again improperly, it appears. These seem to be fundamental properties of language, which should be captured, not obscured. All fully derivational approach captures them, and indeed suggests that they should be pervasive, as seems to be the case.},

[japanese doesn't require roots to be vowel-final, but words must] We are left with the conclusion that the relevant domain of the Japanese constraint against final consonants is the word and not the morpheme.

[odawa]

Now this constraint is certainly not a \emph{morpheme} structure constraint since many morphemes begin with clusters. '

\ldots~independent nouns, which need not be preceded by a prefix, obey the constraint against initial clusters. There are a number of nouns that do not obey the constraint but they are all dependent nouns:

For the skeptical there are two kinds of external evidence which show this MSC is significant and not merely a distributional quirk of the language. First, all loan words are made to conform to it. 

[list of spanish words]

59f.: 

In most Desano dialects [d] is found in word initial position and [r] occurs elsewhere (i.e., intervocalically). Since there is no prefixation in Desano we are not dealing with alternations but rather with strictly distributional facts. Morphemes that are not stems and hence cannot appear in initial position may begin with [r] but never [d].

In the case of \emph{barateru} `hammer' ($<$ \emph{martelo}) the sequence \emph{mara-} is phonetically possible in Desano (cf.~[\~{o}m\~{a}r\~{a}] `to have run') but would imply a morpheme boundary.},

Unlike ratings, comparative judgments generate highly reliable responses, clear individual differences, and allow researchers to test hypotheses that cannot be easily expressed in the ``main- effect plus interaction'' language of analysis of variance \citep{Gigerenzer1990}.

Methods of minimizing the real error include proper choice of task (e.g., paired comparison instead of rating) (see Gigerenzer & Richter, 1990), proper choice of experimental environment (e.g., testing participants individually rather than in large classrooms), proper motivation (e.g., by performance-contingent payment rather than flat sums), instructions that are unambiguous rather than vague, and the avoidance of unnecessary deception of participants about the purpose of the experiment, which can lead to second-guessing and increased variability of responses (Hertwig & Ortmann, 2001).

Only such an integral view can account for the fact that all these apparently so hetereogeneous elements are able to come together in language.
34: [connections between possible syllables and possible signs]
36: possible syllables can be found, like \emph{pid} and \emph{maf}, that are not signs in English. They are unused sign-possibilities, and the fact that they are not used, while certain others are, is pure accident. 
37: A list of the signs of a language---a dictionary---is always necessarily imcomplete, if only because new signs are being formed while the dictionary is being compiled and many more have been formed b efore the dictionary finds its last user. 

English continues to be English even if new words are introduced into it, provided only that the words are formed according to the same rules for constructing syllables and are composed of the same elements as before. 
41: The human ear can be trained to hear very fine nuances, so what was said above about the organs of speech applies here; the ear, too, is a Jack-of-all-trades, but the special training it has had in hearing hte nuances that play a role in the native language reduces its ability to hear the nuances that play a role in other languages, so that a person will often be inclined to declare it physically impossible to perceive the distinctions utilized in a language not his own.
42: an account of the usage of the game [of chess] would have to include information not only about the way one is \emph{permitted} to act (this is the structure of the game), but also how people are accustomed to acting in given situations or have in fact acted up to now (this is the usage of the game)----in othe words, what combinations have time-honored status under given conditions.
44: a \emph{feeling for a language}, or \emph{Sprachgefühl}
48: [peregri:nus: first, not second \emph{r}]

an element in a group in a stressed syllable dissimilates an element standing alone between two vowels---never the other way around.

49: [first and not second element dissimilated]
57: imperative froms di:c, du:c, fac, fer (em means somethign else
60: What is characteristic of foreign words is that they do not follow the laws of the native linguistic structure, but of some foreign structure. They are like minorities living under their own special laws. Consequently, they are often subject to transformation by unlearned speakers following their native Sprachgefühl, or to popular etymology (\emph{very coarse veins} for \emph{varicose veins}). As for loan words that are not foreign words, the man in the street has no suspicion of their origin and will be astounded when told that words like \emph{skirt} (from Scandinavian), \emph{street} (from Latin), or \emph{chair} (from Old French) are loan words.

108: Danish \emph{k\'orset} `the cross' vs. \emph{korsét} `corset'
112: \ldots~the possibility of forming a practically unlimited number of signs with a small number of elements is implied in the very essence and purpose of language.
125: [Saussure] introduced [the phoneme], for lack of a better word, as designation for the expression elements of language in order to avoid confusion with the ``sounds'' of linguistic usage---that is, to designate the purely ``algebraic entities'' of his theory.

As speakers therefore clearly do not have a standard allophone in the base form, there is no basis for even discussing what the uniform paradigm would look like.

26: The champion of this trend calls on linguistics to become ``an algebra of language, operating with unnamed entities, i.e. arbitrarily named entities without natural designation'' \citep{Hjelmslev1953}. 
27: The comparison of two English sequences---/ku/ and /uk/---will yield no information on the identity of the first segment in one of these samples with the second segment in the other sample, unless we bring into play sound properties common to initial and final /k/ and those common to /u/ in both positions. The confrontation of the syllables /ku/ and /ki/ does not authorize us to assign both initial segments to one phoneme /k/ as two variants appearing to their mutual exclusion before two different vowels, unless we have identified the common features, uniting the retracted and advanced variants of the phoneme /k/ and differentiating it from all other phonemes of the same language. Only such a test enables us to decide whether the retracted [k-] in /ku/ implements the same phoneme as the advanced [k+] in /ki/ and not the advanced [g+] in /ki/. 
59: Important feature of innate features is phoneme identification. [see Twadell on this]
60: If, for instance, the Czech /l/, which can occur in identical positions wich each of the 32 other phonemes of the language, is declared `an unanalyzable distinctive unit', its distinction from the other 32 phonemes would require 32 unanalyzable realations, whereas through teh dissolution of the \emph{l} bundle into the three constituent features---vocalic, consonantal, and continuous---its relation to all other phonemes of the pattern is reduced to three binary selections.},

1. pisum ``pois'' = [GREEK] (Curtius, n. 366). Le nom de famille Piso est un d{é}riv{é} de pisum qui en garantit l'anciennet{é}.
2. [GREEK] ``souffle'', cp. pusida (Curtius, n*^ 652). Le mot grec se trouve aussi {é}crit avec double CTCT, ce qui n'est sans doute qu'une mani{è}re d'exprimer la sifflante particuli{è}rement forte {à} laquelle nous avons affaire.
3. miser, cp. [GREKE] (Curtius, p. 582. Corssen, I*. 377). )LiO(Jo{\c c} «action indigne» appartient probablement {à} la m{ê}me racine. --- Le rhotacisme a cependant atteint le mot maeror parent de miser.
4. n{\^a}sus «nez»; cp. nares. Bopp (Gloss.) rapproche vf{\^\i}ao{\c c} «{\^\i}le> de skr. n{\^a}s{\^a}, lat. nasus. Voy. contre cette {é}tymologie Cur- tius, p. 320.
Enfin, est-ce un accident fortuit que les mots ke{\c c}ara, ke{\c c}a qu'on r{é}unit {à} caesaries aient pris en sanscrit la sifflante palatale?
Ces cas sans doute sont peu nombreux, mais le chiffre total des exceptions est {é}galement minime. Parmi le reste des mots qui ont {é}chapp{é} au rhotacisme latin, il n'y en a peut-{ê}tre aucun qui ait son correspondant en grec, en sorte que ce n'est que dans les cas cit{é}s qu'on peut v{é}rifier le fait dont nous parlons. Il y a en revanche des exemples du sigma grec conserv{é} l{à} o{\`u} le latin a r.

Discriminant function analysis of the acoustic cues of calls revealed high similarities between calls when both the individual and the interacting partner were loaded together as grouping variables. In playback experiments, the parrotlets were tested with contact calls of a family member recorded during interaction with the tested bird and with calls of the same stimulus bird recorded during interaction with another family member. The birds responded more often to calls uttered in their presence than to calls uttered in the presence of another family member. This suggests that spectacled parrotlets use contact calls to refer to a social companion and thus are labelling or naming their conspecifics.

Another logical possibility is that a universal hypothesized on the basis of examining one or more languages may actually seem to be \emph{counterexemplified} by another. Indeed, it is difficult to find a single issue of a journal devoted to theoretical linguistics that does not contain an article purporting to show that some proposed constraint on grammars {\copyright} does not work for some language (L).

42: consider the \emph{content} of the rejection of the idea that ``rules should be constructed so as to yield the smallest number of exceptions possible.'' It nis no less than the rejecti on of the goal of finding as much systematicity as exists in language. Perhaps some linguists would be content with a description of a language in which rules were stated with large numers of exceptions, even though it could be demonstrated that the exceptions disappear given an alternative statement of the rules. But such an attitude, it seems to me, represents the abandonment of a scientific perspective on language.

Therefore, for Giv\'on, what the child learns and what the linguist describes must \emph{in principle} be disparate. What a strange view of language is presented in \emph{OUG}, in which a child can learn a syntacticized construction but the linguist is discouraged from characterizing precisely the syntax that the child has learned. 

124:

A theoretical model, on the other hand, is designed to \emph{explain} the data. In the words of the philosopher of science Rom Harré: ``the function of a [theoretical] model is to form the basis of a theory, and a theory is invented to explain some phenomena'' (1970, 52).

152 (Hale n.d.):

Linguistic science has the advantage over other sciences that the data relevant to it are immediately accessible, even to the youngest of students, and it requires a minimum of material equipment. It is possible, using immediately accessible linguistic data, to exercise a stduent's ability to employ the scientific method in coming to grips with problems which compare in their theoretical complexity and importance with problems in the physical sciences whose study (i.e. empirical testing) can be carried out only with the most sophisticated and costly aparatus.

Emonds concludes that the prestige usage of the nominative pronoun in \emph{he and I left} cannot be accounted for by a rule of linguistic competence. In his view, the ``prestige usage is not a grammatical construct, but an extragrammatical deviation imposed \ldots~exclusively through paralinguistic cultural mechanisms of the dominant socio-economic class: exclusive and higher education, standard reference handbooks for business and journalism, paid or unpaid secretarial help, ghost writers, etc.''},

The past tense form /sAN/ is treated as an alternant of /siN/. The meaning-difference is considered as expressed by a zero suffix. By this procedure an overt distinction---the replacement of /i/ by /A/---is treated as meaningless, while the covert distinction becomes the meaning-carrier. I do not deny the significance of zero in such a form, nor the importance of the pattern which leads one to recognize a zero; but it appears to me as strikingly contradictory to treat overt distinctions as meaningless and covert distinctions as meaningful

425:

over-differentiation vs. homonymy

427:

An overt formal difference among related forms (forms containing recurrent partials or occurring in complementary distribution) constitutes a morpheme, if in any of these forms this difference, together with a zero tactical difference, is the only significant feature for establishing a minimal unit of phonetic-semantic distinctiveness. 

428:

[vowel change is a morpheme in "left"]

This occurrence of two morphemes with the structural value of one morpheme in other situations should not unduly disturb us, since the situation occurs in a number of other languages. In Greek, for example, some perfects occur both with reduplication of the initial consonant plus /e/ and with a suffix /-k-/, e.g., /leluk-/ `have loosed'; but others have only the reduplication, e.g., /leloip-/ `have left'.

[/f ? v/ and /s ? z/ alternation in English is not meaningful, because there are overt symbols instead]

430:

The very frequency of occurrence of a form also contributes a feature of linguistic meaning; for it is important on the one hand in establishing patterns of analogy, and on the other in preserving the form against levelling influence. Irregular forms of frequently occurring words (e.g. the forms of the verb \emph{to be} in English) resist levelling analogies which extend to other verbs of less frequent occurrence.

431 (fn. 32):

Any body of material sufficiently extensive to serve adequately as a basis for descriptive analysis must include fluctuations of forms, which are symptomatic of different degrees of acceptability. Synchronic contrasts of this kind are closely allied to contrasts of productivity vs. non-productivity

431 (principle 7):

Related forms which occur in the same environment, but which could otherwise be regarded as allomorphs, can still be so regarded if (a) there is no apparent difference of meaning between them or (b) the difference of meaning is derivable from the distribution of the related forms. Condition (a) is known as free variation.

	Annote = {339: In fact, a morpheme structure rule can be interpreted both as a statement of a constraint on phoneme sequences and as an algorithm for predicting redundant feature values in phoneme sequences. The morpheme structure rule itself is neutral as regards its interpretation. To illustrate, we observe in English that a morpheme-initial nasal cannot be immediately followed by a consonant. This observation will be reflected in a morpheme structure rule which says, in effect, that any segment following a morpheme-initial nasal must be [-Consonantal]. Interpreted as the statement of a constraint on possible phoneme sequences in English, this rule says that no [+Consonantal] segment can follow a morpheme-initial nasal. Interpreted as a algorithm for predicting redundant feature values, the rule shows that the value of the feature Consonantal may be left blank in segments immediately following a morpheme-initial nasal, since this value is predictably '-' (i.e. 'minus') in this position. Thus, a full set of morpheme structure rules for a language will do two things: it will state, in terms of features, all constraints on what sequences of phonemes are possible in morphemes, and it will allow each morpheme to have a representation in which redundant feature values are omitted.                                                                       
394: It has been common for linguists to view phonological redundancy as a statistical entity to be treated in the way redundancy is treated in information theory [citations ommitted]. 

397: The constraints holding within single morphemes are more restrictive than the constraints which characterize larger units. [FALSE]

398: The MS [morpheme structure--KG] rules, on the other hand, must not do any of these things; their sole function is to fill in blank entries with the proper values (`+' or `-'), for, as noted, they are exclusively redundancy rules. 

399: excellent figure on segmental redundancy

400: [can rule out more specified phonemes]

Sequence structure rules: e.g.,

X -> [+vocalic, -consonantal] / # [-vocalic, -consonantal] __

(initial glide must be followed by a vowel)

401: If, on the other hand, we interpret the set of sequence structure rules as a statement of constraints on systematic phoneme sequences, then this set provides a characterization of the set of `possible' morphemes of Russian. This fact is clear if, as is quite natural, we regard a `possible'  morpheme as a form which may or may not occur in the lexicon, but whose phonological structure violates no sequence structure rule (and of course, no segment structure rule) of the language. [fn. 8 here]

401 (fn. 8): Of course, to obtain the desired results, we must guarantee that each sequence structure rule reflects a general systematic fact about the language, and not a fact which is due merely to the existence of accidental gaps in the lexicon. This guarantee is provided by the criterion of simplicity, which gives a well-motivated means of separating the accidental sequential constraints from the systematic ones; according to this criterion only the systematic ones can be stated in the sequence structure rules \citep[][340-342]{Halle1964}. This means that the sequence structure rules provide a means of distinguishing accidental gaps in the lexicon from gaps whose existence is due to a general fact about the language. 

401 (continuing onward): Thus the sequence structure rules, though included in the grammar to characterize redundancy, provide as a by-product a characterization of the notion `possible morpheme'; this obviates the need for a separate set of statements to characterize this notion (cf. \citealt[][341--342]{Halle1964}).

\ldots~there are certain kinds of rules which must apply in the P rules but which, at least in some of the environments where they apply, function as redundancy rules. Rules of `neutralization' have this property \ldots~It is clear that if this environment is limited to sequences which are contained within a single morpheme and which cannot extend across morpheme boundaries, then the sequential constraints will be stated as a sequence structure rule and will be included in the set of MS rules.

while the total output of the source grammar with respect to some phonological sequence may provide more than sufficient evidence for an unambiguous parse of that sequence, the acquirer gets only a subset of the evidence. 

352-353:

Indeed, as mentioned above, it is not clear that notions such as ``optimization'' and ``simplification'' have any interesting role to play in diachronic linguistics. For example, suppose that it is ``simpler'' or ``more optimal'' not to maintain obstruent voicing contrasts in codas. This principle would be ``phonetically grounded'' in that voicing contrasts in stops are both articulatorily ``difficult'' and perceptually non-salient in codas.  German final devoicing would then be the result of ``optimization,'' under hte type of model Kiparsky is proposing. But notice that this principle does the acquirer of German no good -- such an acquirer receives no input data which contain coda voiced obstruents and thus constructs a grammar without such entities with or without this ``optimization'' principe. Moreover, for the acquirer of English, this universal principle is irrelevant (or misleading): the input data contain final voiced obstruents, so regardless of how non-optimal or complex such segments are, the grammar such an acquirer constructs must generate them. [footnote omitted] If we contrast the ``optimization'' explanation for coda devoicing with a misparsing analysis of the type I have proposed in this chapter, the advantages of the latter are clear. Final voiced obstruents are ``articulatorily difficult,'' which, if [it] can be made to mean anything coherent, presumably entails that this aspect of that target articulation is frequently missed (i.e., obstruents in this position are ``less voiced'' or even devoiced in real-time production). Second, they are not particularly salient perceptually in this context. Clearly these two factors will conspire to lead to changes of the final obstruent devoicing type (and greatly disfavor final obstruent voicing as a change), regardless of \emph{computational} optimality or simplicity. The change arises as a result of strictly extralinguistic factors (articulation and perception). 

353-354:

We can easily construct scenarios whereby a given morphologically complex form, derived via some rule of the lexical phonology requiring an exception feature on the underlying representation of one (or more) of the morphemes involved, could fail to be a relevant part of the child's input. For example, `\meph{kine}' (the archaic plural of `\emph{cow}') could have been lacking altogether in the PLD of an acquirer at the relevant point or it could have failed to be associated by the acquirer with `\emph{cow}' (i.e., it could be lexicalized as a separate entity, meaning `cattle' or some such). Nevertheless the speaker may later find himself or herself in a position which required the production fo that morphologically complex form (e.g., the plural of `\emph{cow}') -- ldeaing to a default realization (`\emph{cows}'), since no exception feature will have been stored with that lexeme. The same scenario cannot hold, however, for a phonological representation. To fail to acquire the underlying phonological representation of a given lexeme is to lack that lexeme altogether (the lexicon is a set of phonological-semantic linkings). One cannot later have to produce some forms such as `\emph{took}' or `\emph{mad}' for which one has not positied, on the basis of the acquisition evidence, some phonological representation. Put differently, the existence of a free concatenation process in the morphology will force the speaker to produce many morphologically complex words which were not part of the input evidence during grammar construction (just as a similar concatenation process in the syntactic component will allow the speaker to generate novel sentences). 

354:

This is the critical difference between ``input'' and ``derived'' representations: input representations must be posited during the acquisition process in order to exist at all; derived representations are freely generable. 

355:

The key difference here is that final consonant deletion, which is ``extending'' its environment in the same manner as takes place in Kiparsky's examples, is not a rule in any synchronic grammar: it is part of the relationship between one grammar (the source) and another (the acquirer's constructed grammar). The ``rule'' is merely a description of a diachronic event, not part of any linguistic system, and thus not constrained by the principles of synchronic phonology. In our view this reveals the fundamental shortcoming of Kiparsky's method: it posits synchronic processes constrained by current theoretical models to account for events which were not necessarily ever part of any individual's linguistic competence (cf Janda's 1990, 1994a, similar criticisms). 
	The processes taking place \emph{within} a grammar are constrained by the principles of UG -- they must be consistent with the computational capabilities of the cognitive system within which they are located. By contrast, the relationships indicated by the ``Change'' arrow of figure 7.2 do not reside in any cognitive system and thus are in no way constrained by the computational limitations of humans. Since a diachronic event is not dependent upon a human organism actually having a process of the type in question in her or his cognitive system, it does not seem useful to assume that constraints on rule formalisms in the synchronic system have any role to play in the account of diachronic misanalyses, which in many, if not all, cases result from extragrammatical features of the human perceptual system. 

356:

We know of no argument that the latter -- the mapping relationship -- shoudl have the properties of a human phonological system. 

357:

It is possible that there are structural faetures which \emph{favor} a particular change (making it more trivial) or disfavor a particular change (making it less trivial), but these have nothign to do with the principles of UG, which only require of a given change that the result of its taking place in a given grammar will give rise to a \emph{possible} human linguistic system.

358: 

If the core context for change is reanalysis during the acquisition period, there can hardly be structure-dependence of the type usually advocated. The structure is not given; it does not exist for teh acquirer; it is, in fact, what is being constructed. Only the output fo the acquirer's source(s) is given. Any analysis which is consistent with this output (and of course with the principles of UG) is possible. The constraints on change will therefore be a combination of the set of possible (mis)analyses of the input data (many of which are presumably ambiguous -- that is, consistent with more than one grammar) and the global constraint that holds that the result of opting for various choices made possible by these ambiguities will be consistent with UG. 

359:

The question of course is: how can they exist? How can a language which does not have a restriction against closed syllables (as pre-proto-Slavic did not) acquire a compulsion to develop one, a compulsion which achieves its desired goals only hundreds of years later? Kiparsky acknowledges that this ``mysterious mechanism of orthogenesis \ldots~itself has no explanation'' (section 2.1). Indeed, ``has no explanation'' is rather weak in its criticism of such a hypothesis. Where would such a conspiracy reside and how would it exercise its influence on grammar construction over such a long span of time? Why would a ``language'' (if we even wanted to admit the relevance of such a concept into our considerations) conspire for generations to attain the point where it has only open syllables, only to surrender this feature shortly thereafter? 

360:

Moreover, the proposal demands that the acquirer, during the acquisition process, have access to ``language-specific structural principles,'' though these are presumably available only \emph{after} the specific language in question has bee nacquired. 

[tonogenesis counterexamples]

361:

Indeed, there is a very real danger that constrained proposed on synchronic phonological systems (proposed because there are no known exceptions in the languages we have studied so far) are in fact not synchronic constraints at all. 

361-362:

However -- and here's the rub -- diachronic events provide us with the bulk of our evidence for ``possible'' phonological rules: the morphophonemic alternations which form the backbone of phonological rule systems are the result of diachronic events. It is entirely plausible, in my view, that the set of possible phonological processes is a superset of the set of possible diachronic misanalyses, in which case no cross-linguistic survey of phonological processes -- which is necessary restricted to those processes which have resulted from diachronic misanalyses -- will reveal the actual computational capabilities (in the phonological domain) of the species. },

All these theories depend on the veracity of the Affix Ordering Generalization, though some more than others. It is therefore unfortunate that this generalization is false, a fact which was noted in the first published metnion of Siegel's original observation (Aronoff, 1976)

Strauss [1982] concludes that the Affix Ordering Generalization is strictly linear, and not applicable to affixes on opposite sides of a stem.

Eivdence of this type forces one to fall back on epicyclic ordering of levels, which, as noted in Aronoff (1976) in connection with another matter, is tantamount to lack of ordering in such cases.

	Annote = {394: The answer appears to lie in the processes of perception and acquisition. Functional considerations do not block speakers from uttering ambiguous productions, but ambiguous utterances present a perceptual problem for hearers. Sometimes it must be the case that they are misconstrued. In the English case, this would mean that some past tense forms undergoing CSD would be heard as present tense. Such misconstruals will be effectively bled from the perceived corpus: a verb form heard as present tense is not seen as having any relevance to CSD in past tense forms. Therefore, since only ambiguous forms are bled, the perceived corpus will appear to language hearers to have fewer applications of a process in the environments where it does not; in the CSD case, this means that hearers will perceive a lower rate of deletion in \emph{packed}, \emph{bowled}, \emph{missed}, than in \emph{pact}, \emph{bold}, \emph{mist}. This effect will be proportional to functional load, because where redundancy reduces ambiguity, fewer bleedings from the perceived corpus by misconstrual will occur. Diachronically, this implies a constant pressure on child language learners to construct a mental grammar in the course of language acquisition that preserves information that has a high functional load. Variation data suggest that they do this not by directly constructing functional constraints on production [or drawing upon them], but by reference to formal devices such as inhibition of CSD in affixes. Nevertheless, the normal processes of perception and acquisition will act to preserve functionality in the long run, even in the absence of production constraints.},

In this article, based on both diachronic and synchronic phonotactic patterns in English, we further distinguish the category of accidental gaps as \textsc{lexically} versus \textsc{phoologically} accidental. 
But there are other kinds of adventitious gaps in the word inventory, which, though not systematic in the sense of being phonologically prohibited like \emph{bnick}, are nonetheless regular, or nearly so, and in fact can be described in broad phonological terms.

Since this evidence is drawn not from the performance of a single aphasic but from the daily behaviour of millions of ordinary Poles, thie analysis presumably does not bear on psychological reality, by standard criteria. If Poles were dolphins, the irrationality of this distinction would be apparent to almost everyone.

Semantic relatedness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for priming

19: 

\citet{Taft1975}, for example, classified certain historically prefixed forms as synchronically unprefixed on the basis that the prefix had become semantically opaque. The \emph{re-} in \emph{rebel}, for example, no longer has any implications of ``again'', so that \emph{rebel} is classified as pseudoprefixed. This prefix-based criterion leads to forms such as \emph{replenish} and \emph{repugnant} being classified as synchronically prefixed. Our view is that the semantics of the stem are equally, if no more, important so that \emph{replenish} and \emph{repugnant}, compared with transparent cases like \emph{refill} or \emph{remarry}, will not be represented in the mental lexicon in morphologically decomposed form because their ``stems'' (\emph{-plenish} or \emph{-pugnant}) have no synchronic semantic interpretation on the basis of which the meanings of the derived forms could be computed.

Experiment 4: priming between insincere/sincere and unfasten/refasten (the latter much larger)

Experiment 6: priming between distrust/trustful, judgement/misjudge

Latin \emph{honor} is the best guess from the nominative singular if just the oblique paradigm \emph{hon\=orem} \emph{hon\=oris} etc.~is under consideration, but creates a complication if retanied in teh face of the more peripheral datum of \emph{honestus} coupled with the \emph{s} $\rightarrow$ \emph{r} rule needed for \emph{fl\=os} \emp{fl\=oris} etc. \ldots It is possible  (though not necessary) to make the additional, logically independent assumption that learners are stuck with their own `wrong' \emph{analyses} \ldots

The lexical diffusion of tense \emph{\ae} before certain consonants in New York and Philadelphia studied by Labov and his associates migh be a case where outputs of variable non-neutralization rules have become lexicalized. However, it remains to be cleared up what role the 19th century prestige pronunciation of `broad \emph{a}' words like \emph{ask}, which clearly was phonemic, played in the history of the tensing process.

        A correspondent to this list wonders why, in a grammar $G$ such that $G$(a) $=$ G$(b) for potential input elements /a/, /b/, a nonalternating observed element [a] is not (sometimes, always, freely) lexically /b/. 

        The correct answer is surely `why bother?'---i.e.~to set up /b/ for [a] when /a/ will do. This line of approach was taken up by Stampe in the late '60s--early '70s, (and independently noted by Dell in his text of roughly the same vintage). Hence the term `Stampean occultation'---the possibility of /b/ for [a] is *hidden* by the possibility of /a/. The basic idea reappears as `lexicon optimization' in recent discussions.},

@article{Anderson1988a,
	Annote = {521: Since English has very little inflectional morphology, and its derivational morphology is often associated with lexical idiosyncrasy, the ratio of possible word forms encountered in text to necessarily listed lexical items is comparatively low.

524: The advantage of morphology for such a demonstration is due to the existence of a vast literature in psychology on the fine structure of human behavior when performing much the same task a computational system is engaged in: recognizing and retrieving words and recovering the information they bear. Lexical-access and lexical-decision tasks are a standard paradigm in psychology, and a great deal is known about how words of various types are recognized. [footnote omitted] Of course, as with most extensively studied areas, the results to be found in the psychological literature on lexical access are somewhat controversial, as the interpretation to be given to performance on such key experimental tasks as lexical decision. Nonetheless, the existence of such a considerable body of concrete empirical data probably makes the implicit claims about performance made by a computational system more significantly testable in the domain of morphology than elsewhere in the study of natural language. Computational morphology thus offers us a chance, at least in principle, to determine whether or not the constructs of (this part of) linguistic theory are appropriate as a description of human linguistic behavior. 

525: /karahka-i-ta/ `stick (pl. partitive)'
karahko-i-ta (a -> o / __ i)
karahko-i-a (t -> \zr / __ V[-long])
karahkoja (glide formation)

530: Every phonological rule has to express a transparent surface-true well-formedness condition on the relation between underlying and surface forms. This is the kind of condition that is associated with a phonological theory like that of `natural generative phonology' (see \citealt{Hooper1976}), and a substantial majority of phonologists would probably agree that the discussion of that position in the 1970s showed i to be seriously inadequate as an account of phonological structure.

532:

/k@mba/ /gampaN/ 
k@mbo   ---    (a -> 0 / __ #)
k@mbu   gampiN (elative rule: V -> [+high] / __ #)

[i]t is necessary to apply the (phonological) rule rounding final /a/ \textsc{before} the rule forming the elative, since /a/s that have been rounded raise to [u] in the elative, wheras those that have not raise to [i] \ldots~the morphological formation must be undone before the phonological rule (starting from the surface form).  

533: Of course, if words are exhaustively divisible into morphemes, it might seem obvious that an analysis ought to consist of an indication of just what morphemes are present in a given word. That is the acocount aimplied by a parser that analyzes a word by indicating where one morpheme stops and the next one begins, and what meaning is associated with each (as virtually all current parsing systems do). 

541: One thing that is known, however, is that human cognitive processing is unlikely to make use of long and complicated procedures applied very quickly oen step at a time (comparable to the operation of standard serial computations). Rather, human neural computation is apparently quite slow \ldots~but involves massive parallelism. 

543 (endnote 6): \ldots~this begs the question of whether in fact we \textsc{want} to model human performance by a universal procedure. Perhaps Turksih speakers employ strategies that are peculiarly adapted to Turkish. This appears to be an issue that sharply divides linguists from (most) psychologists. 

543 (endnote 10): For instance, if the parser is intended to model behavior in spoken language use, it is not obvious that priming effects due to purely orthographic influences should be reflected in its operation.},

81: \v{S}\v{c}erba's conception [of the phoneme] acquires another aspect which was not so generally accepted. It seems quite plausible (indeed, necessary) on this view to regard the sound which represents the underlying intention of the speaker as a `basic variant' which is transformed into various secondary variants under some (but not all) conditions.

114 (Trubetzkoy): [k ~ \v{c}] alternation in Russian is really /{k, \v{c}}/.

126-127: Directly echoing Trubetzkoy's rejection of Baudouin's conception of the phoneme as the psychological equivalent of a speech sound, Jakobson and Halle (1956) argue that such a psychological picture is based on a fallacy: ``we have no right to presume that the sound correlate in our \emph{internal} speech or in our speech intention is confined to the distinctive features to the exclusion of the configurative or redundant features.''

145 (Hjelmslev): Virtually all of [Hjelmslev's] papers dealing with sound structure contain at least as an aside, and sometimes as the main point, a reproof of `phonology' as making an important conceptual mistake in basing its analysis on considerations of substance---especially on phonetic properties. 

147 (Hjelmslev): The only way to study language on its own right, according to [Hjelmslev], was to develop a notion of linguistic structure completely independent of the specifics of either phonetic realization or concrete intentional meaning. 

151 (Hjelmslev): The goal of linguistics, in glossematics terms, is the development of an `algebra' (or notational system) within which all possible linguistic systems can be expressed.

158 (Hjelmslev): - /h/ in French
- "irresolveable" syncretism (cf. Stampe etc.) when, e.g., word-final /d/ "would" be devoiceed

163 (Hjelmslev): \ldots he maintained constantly that the following constraint applied to consonant clusters in all (or at least nearly all) languages: if C$_1$C$_2$C$_3$ is a possible cluster, than both C$_1$C$_2$ and C$_2$C$_3$ must be possible as well. In other words, all clusters of more than two elements must be made up of sequences that are well formed in a local, pairwise fashion as well.
212: Boas and Deloria have feeding and bleeding orders in their Dakota grammar
221: The appeal of research which takes on at least the trappings of `science' has of course not disappeared; one can argue about the extent to which such considerations distort scholarly judgements in particular cases \ldots
226: Current typologial work (at its best, at least) seeks to establish necessary connections among phenomena; for example, Greenberg's celebrated typology of SOV, SVO, and VSO languages was inteded not simply to specify the range of freedom available to the languages of the world with respect to the major constituents of the sentence, but also to bring out connections between that relative order and other features, such as the relatieve order of nouns and modifying adjectives, the choice of prepositions or postpositions, etc.
233: It is quite clear (and often remarked) that Sapir allowed for many descriptions in which the phonemic representation of a form cannot be determined from its phonetic form alone \ldots Such a possibility arises becaus phonemic elements are construed not as recodings of phonetics forms but as an inner psychological reality that corresponds to the physical event of speech, where the correspondence is mediated by a system of (possibly quite complex) rules.
239: Sapir on 3-mora words in Southern Paiute 
266: To appreciate the linguistic significance of this [underlying] representation, however, it is necessary to recognize that the system of a language has properties other than those of a minimal code for distinguishing and conveying meanings in communication.
267: On Bloomfield and junctures
334: The general lack of practical repercussions of markedness theory seems to be due at least in part to the fact that the set of marking conventions required to account for the facts of one language (or group of languages) simply do not extend to comparable utility in others.},

Well designed and properly executed experiments designed to test levels of
grammaticality could yield important information. This would especially be the
case if the experiments were designed to test a theoretically sound hypothesis.
Such an [sic] hypothesis would be in the form of an abstract device which would
automatically assign phoneme strings to the levels of grammtaicality; the
hypothesis would, of course, be compatible wiht a general linguistic theory.
The experiments would serve the purpose of testing the validity of the
hypothesis. However, not only were the experiments described by the author not
intended to test any hypothesis, they were so poorly designed and analyzed that
the data are not at all useful. There were no controls, the materials were not
properly balanced, and no discussion of the statistical reliability of the data
is presented.

No mention of [#TH W], but "Moreover, it is probably that the redundancy rules
for English lexical forms would be simplified by the classification of this
cluster as fully grammatical, since it could then be claimed that any unvoiced
apical-alveolar obstruent may appear before a \emph{w}.

It strikes this reviewer as incomprehensible that \emph{mn-} and \emph{ly-} be
considered valid initial clusters of standard American English.

40: A statistical analysis of the number of aspirated consonants and the number of words of different syllable counts suggests that although the absence of forms with hetereorganic aspirated obstruents is not accidental, the lack of forms containing identical aspirated obstruents could be accidental. We would expect only 1 such form in a dictionary of this size; the lack of any such forms could be due to chance. 
[chi-square analysis]

42-43: However, although the evidence discussed so far does not establish the existence of a cooccurrence restriction against identical aspirated obstruents, the existence of such a restriction is supported by the analysis offered in chapter 5 (where I argue that such forms must have been absent in the language), and by three Ofo words analyzed by de Reuse 1981. De Reuse presents three Ofo words \ldots and proposes that these words involve reduplicated verb stems which have been subjected to his deaspiration rule. For example, de Reuse analyzes ___ `to whine' as /ta/ + reduplicated /s\super{h}i/ + /hi/. If the deaspiration rule applies to identical aspirated segments, this suggests that the intramorphemic coocccurence restrictions also prohibited the cooccurence of these segments.

There has been much controversy as to the particular details of the formulation of the sonority scale. It is impossible to do justice to this large and interesting topic here. Most researchers agree on something like vowels $>$ glides $>$ liquids $>$ nasals $>$ obstruents (Bell & Hooper 1978, Clements 1990, Smolensky 1995, Holt 1997), but there is little agreement on the relative sonority of laterals/rhotics, voiced/voiceless stops, stops/fricatives/affricates and the place of glottals on the sonority hierarchy. For some alternative formulations and discussion, see Selkirk (1984a) and Blevins (1995). See especially Parker (2002) for a recent and very thorough literature review. The particular formulation given here follows Jespersen (1904) (see also Alderete 1995, Boersma 1998, Hironymous 1999), and is chosen because its details optimally fit the facts of Faroese, Icelandic, Kazakh and Kirghiz. The details of the sonority scale do not affect the general thrust of the proposal.

[expectated E] assumes independence of \emph{A} and \emph{B}, which is the null hypothesis under investigation. To the extent that the predicted value differs significantly from the observed cooccurrences, we have reason to believe that some outside factor --- such as the OCP --- is intervening and must be accounted for.

377: A particularly important contribution to this field [``phoneme combination and phoneme classification''] has been made by the Danish linguist \textsc{Henning Spang-Hanssen} in his book ``Probability and Structural Classification in Language Description'' (1959). The most characteristic feature of the book is the strong emphasis on the prognostic character of linguistic description. The observed material is taken as a sample drawn at random from an assumed larger text, which constitutes an open material. The aims of a linguistic description of texts is to set up a prediction on the occurrence of certain phenomena in texts not yet examined, in particular all texts in a certain language. This description will always be in the nature of the a hypothesis, and rules can only mean ``rules by hypothesis'' (not by definition). When formulating a rule, exceptions can be set up explicitly. Different from exceptions are counter-cases, i.e., a case contradictory to the hypothesis. It is the number of counter-cases which determine the prognostic value. But a smaller number of counter-cases do not prevent the formulation of rules. Similar ideas came to play a role later in generative grammar; but typical of Spang-Hanssen's approach is the probabilistic point of view: structure is seen as deviation from randomness. Not only empty places, but also places showing a number considerably smaller than other places may represent deviations from chance.},

25-26: restructuring because resulting grammar is unstable
28-29: In later Old English and early Middle English, there was a rule of Degemination that affected geminate consonantal clusters at the ends of words and before immediately following consonants. 
29: Further evidence of the loss of this constraint [on Degemination] is found in adjectival forms such as \emph{fel} `fierce' beside its inflected form \emph{felle}. 
32 (en. 3): The assumption that geminated forms are derived from an underlying ungeminated stem rather than vice versa may not be self-evidence. It is based upon the observation that whenever the initial /i/of the ending is folowed by something other than a vowel, i.e., either a consonant or a word boundary, the process of degemination does not occur. A rule which derives \emph{frem} from \emph{fremm} requires a more complicated account, since the number of disjoint environments in which gemination does not take place is larger than those in which it does occur. (3) is therefore to be preferred over a rule of Degemination.

14-15: Given a small selection of English verb stems such as \emph{catch}, \emph{dodge}, \emph{learn}, \emph{lie}, \emph{ring}, \emph{see}, \emph{swing}, \emph{walk}, \emph{want}, it might not be predictable by any general rule what the past tense form of any particular verb will be. Nevertheless, it will be predictable that there is a past tense form for each of these verbs. [alternative view]...productivity should be viewed in terms of the slot in the paradigm rather than in terms of the individual patterns which can be used to fill that slot. This is, in effect, the view of separationist theories, like that of Beard (1995). According to this alternative view we would say that `past-tense formation is productive in English' rather than `\emph{-ed} suffixation is productive in English'.

19: Most grammars of Botha's period actually do contain rules for generating ungrammatical strings, at least in their phonologies.\ldots{}Botha goes on to suggest that the notion of restricted productivity might be given some reality within transformational grammar in terms of an index derived from the number of restrictions there are on the productivity of a given item. 

22: Schultink (1961) --- and following him a number of linguists, especially from the Netherlands, such as Booij and Van Marle --- wish to exclude words which are intentionally coined, leaving only such words as are automaticlaly coined without speakers or hearers necessarily being aware of them. 
31: It may thus be that a word like \emph{Maoris} is grammatical but not acceptable for such speakers. 
34: If, as [Van Santen] so nicely phrasess it, `Productivity is manifested in the space between the existing and the impossible' (Van Santen 1992:72; LB's translation), then we must be able to recognise the existing. 
41: For a coinage to occur, there has to be a need (Bauer 1999b), a real or perceived gap in the speaker's lexicon. (I say `perceived gap' here, because the need may arise from temporary memory failure or from ignorance of an established word, as well as from the absence of any appropriate lexeme in the norm of the language being used.) 
50: Aronoff (1983:168) makes the claim that `semantic complexity and [token] frequency go hand in hand', and argues that lexicalised words have a higher token frequency than do non-lexicalised ones. 
56: Here `regular' seems to mean `freely generalisable' (thus explicitly in Marcus et al. 1995:216). Pinker and Prince (1988:135) talk about distinguishing `real from apparent regularities' where the `real' ones are those which speakers can generalise over and `apparent regularities' appear to refer to unproductive minor patterns.

189:

The iterative principle always produces a counterbleeding as opposed to a bleeding interaction, because it is exactly like simultaneous application as far as the original input string is concerned.

But it is exactly this reason that the iterative-application principle must be rejected. It cannot produce the bleeding multiple applications required by the Gidabal and Carib examples. A Gidabal form containing more than two successive long vowels will always be converted into the wrong output by shortening all vowels but the first. The correct output, in which only the second, fourth, and suceeding even-numbered vowels in a string of successive long vowels are shortened, can be obtained only if the SD of the rule makes use of the infinite schema notation. Hence, all the arguments against simultaneous application in examples like this apply to the iterative principle as well. 

In addition, the interative principle cannot deal effectively with the counter-feeding interactions found in languages like Hidatsa and Tonkawa. If the Hidatsa apocope rule is applied iteratively, /#kikua/#/ will be converted to /#kiku#/ by one application of the rule. This derived string also meets the SD of the apocope rule. According to the iterative principle the rule must be applied a second time. But this produces the incorrect *\emph{kik}. 

In permitting a rule to apply to its own output the iterative principle is a step in the right direction. However, like free reapplication, it is too strong in its claim that a rule must always be reapplied whenever its SD is met. Evidentally, then, some device must be developed that will permit control over when reapplication will occur.},

No matter how much computer power and statistics ... [connectionists] throw at the task [of language acquisition], it always comes out ... wrong. Take Elman's famous paper -- the most quoted in [cognitive science,] I've been told -- on learned nested dependencies. Two problems: (1) the method works just as well on crossing dependencies, so doesn't bear on why language near universally has nested but not crossing dependencies. (2) His program works up to depth two, but fails totally on depth three. So it's about as interesting as a theory of arithmetical knowledge that handles the ability to add 2+2 but has to be completely revised for 2+3 (and so on indefinitely). Such approaches could do far better trying to duplicate bee communication or for that matter what's happening outside the window (where they would do vastly better than physicists). Why don't they do it? Because it would be ludicrous: no scientist is interested in some way of matching data.

63:

Modern linguistics has also failed to deal with the Cartesian observations regarding human language in any serious way. Bloomfield, for example, observes that in a natural language "the possibilities of combination are practically infinite", so that there is no hope for accounting for language use on the basis of repetition or listing, but he has nothing further to say on the problem beyond the remark that the speaker utters new forms "\emph{on the analogy} of similar forms which he has heard." Similarly, Hockett attributes innovation completely to "analogy." Similar remarks can be found in Paul, Saussure, Jespersen, and many others. To attribute the creative aspect of language use to "analogy" or "grammatical patterns" is to use these terms in a completely metaphorical way, with no clear sense and with no relation to the technical usage of linguistic theory.},

``languages are the best mirror of the human mind'' (Leibniz)

4:

Generative grammar is sometimes referred to as a theory, advocated by this or that person. In fact, it is not a theory any more than chemistry is a theory. Generative grammar is a topic, which one may or may not choose to study. Of course, one can adopt a point of view from which chemistry disappears as a discipline (perhaps it is all done by angels with mirrors). In this sense, a decision to study chemistry does stake out a position on maters of fact.

7:

languages poses in a sharp and clear form what has sometimes been called ``Plato's problem,'' the probably of ``poverty of stimulus,'' of accounting for the richness, complexity, and specificity of shared knowledge, given the limitations of the data available.

16:

Consider the way we describe a child or a foreigner learning English. We have no way of referring directly to what that person knows: It is not English, nor is it some other language that resembles English. We do not, for example, say taht the person has a perfect knowledge of some language L, similar to English but still different from it. What we say is that the child or foreigener has a ``partial knowledge of English,'' or is ``on his or her way'' towards acquiring knowledge of English, and if they reach the goal, they will then know English. 

17:

Surely there is some property of mind P that would enable a person to acquire a language under conditions of pure and uniform experience, and surely P (characterized by UG) is put to use under the real conditions of language acquisition. To deny these assumptions would be bizarre indeed: It would be to claim either that language can be learned only under conditions of diversity and conflicting evidence, which is absurd, or that the property P exists---there exists a capacity to learn language in the pure and uniform case---but the actual learning of language does not involve this capacity.

31:

E-languages are not given, but are derivative, more remote from data and from mechanisms than I-languages and the grammars that are theories of I-languages; the choice of E-language therefore raises a host of new and additional problems beyond those connected with grammar and I-language.

The belief that E-language is a fairly clear notion whereas I-language or grammar raises serious, perhaps intractable philosophical problems, is quite mistaken.

It should be noted that familiar characterizations of "language" as a code or a game point correctly towards I-language, not the artificial construct E-language. A code is not a set of representations but rather a specific system of rules that assigns coded representations to message-representations.

Similarly, a game is not a set of moves but rather the rule system that underlies them.

33:

Knowing everything about the mind/brain, a Platonist would argue, we still have no basis for determining the truths of arthimetic or set theory, but there is not the slightest reason to suppose that there are truths of language which would still escape our grasp.

37:

If a theory of language failed to account for these judgements, it would plainly be a failure; we might, in fact, conclude that it is not a theory of language, but rather something else.

38:

Because evidence from Japanese can evidently bear on the correctness of a theory of S$_0$, it can have indirect---but very powerful---bearing on the choice of a grammar that attempts to characterize the I-language attained by a speaker of English. 

For this reason alone it is quite wrong to suppose that there are no grounds to choose among ``extensionally equivalent grammars'' for a ``given language'' (see pp. 20, 30-1): One of these might, for example, require a theory of S_0 that is demonstrably inadequate for some other language.

39:

Similarly, two theories of UG that are equivalent in that they specify exactly the same set of attainable I-languages might be distinguishable in terms of properties of the brain. For example, one might contain certain principles and possibilities of variation that can be readily explained in terms of brain mechanisms, and the other not.

50 (en. 29):

A stronger requirement would be that UG specify \emph{exactly} the I-languages attainable under normal conditions. It is not obvious, however, that UG meets this condition. The attainable languages are those that fall in the intersection of those determined by UG and the humanly learnable systems, and conditions on learnability might exclude certain grammars permitted by UG.

52:

Suppose we regard S$_0$ as a function mapping a collection of data E to a state attained. If E is the totality of data available to the language learner, then the steady state S$_s$ attained is S$_0$(E), the result of applying the principles of S$_0$ to E.

147:

The systems called ``languages'' in common sense usage tolerate exceptions: irregular morphology, idioms, and so forth. These exceptions do not fall naturally under the principles-and-parameters conception of UG. Suppose we distinguish \emph{core language} from \emph{periphery}, where a core language is a system determined by fixing values for the parameters of UG, and the periphery is whatever is added on in the system actually represented in the mind/brain of a speaker-hearer.

What a particular person has in the mind/brain is a kind of artifact resulting from the interplay of accidental factors, as contrasted with the more significant reality of S$_0$ and core language (with its core grammar), a specific selection among the options permitted in the initial state.

The distinction between core and periphery leaves us with three notions of markedness: core versus periphery, internal to the core, and internal to the periphery. The second has to do with the way parameters are set in the absence of evidence. As for the third, there are, no doubt, significant regularities even in departures from the core principles (for example, in irregular verb morphology in English), and it may be that peripheral constructions are related to the core in systematic ways, say, by relaxing certain conditions of core grammar.

For example, we would expect phenomena that belong to the periphery to be supported by specific evidence of sufficient ``density'', to be variable among languages and dialects, and so forth.

150:

The thesis of strong nativism then follows from the assumption that the learning function $f$ is not disturbed by a limited amount of noise

261:

To rephrase the point in the terms of contemporary discussion: the cognitive system involved in use of language is ``cognitively penetrable'' in the sense of Pylyshyn (1984) and other current work; that is, our goals, beliefs, expectations, and so forth clearly enter into our decision to use the rules in one way or another, and principles of rational inference and the like may also play a role in these decisions. This is true not only of what we decide to say but how we decide to say it, and similar factors enter at some level into determining how we understand what we hear.

Consider, for example, the pronunciation rule P, discussed earlier, that merges lax and tense /i/ before /g/ in dialects in which \emph{regal} and \emph{wriggle} are pronounced alike. A speaker of this dialect may choose to ignore the rule, and to apply instead the rule of the standard dialect, for one reason or another; this may be done, in fact, without any awareness of what the rule is or even that it exists. Or consider again the ``garden path'' sentence (7) (see Chapter 2, note 12):

the horse raced past the barn fell (7)

In normal circumstances, a speaker of English presented with (7) will judge that it is not a sentence; this decision is presumably reached by applying the rules R$_1$ that interpret ``the horse raced past the barn'' as a clause, so that \emph{fell} has no role and the principle
FI (full interpretation) is violated. But with prior instruction or experience, the same speaker might well use the different rules R$_2$, interpreting ``the horse raced past the barn'' as a reduced relative clause construction, the subject of ``fell,'' so that (7) is given the meaning ``the horse that was raced past the barn fell.'' It is entirely possible that quite different rules are used in the two cases, so that the process of sentence perception is cognitively penetrable, influenced by factors that might involve expectations, reasoning, and so on.

But while the system of language use is cognitively penetrable in this sense, the system of principles S$_0$ presumably is not; it merely functions as a kind of automatism.

saying that a job is ``only'' an information-processing task or that an organism is ``only'' an information-processing machine is not a limiting or a pejorative description. \ldots One of the fascinating features of information-processing machines is that in order to understand them completely, one has to be satisfied with one's explanation at many different levels.

15:

Suppose, for example that one actually found the apocryphal grandmother cell. [fn.:A cell that fires only when one's grandmother comes into view.] Would that really tell us anything much at all? It would tell us that it existed---Gross's hand-detectors tell us almost that---but not \emph{why} or even \emph{how} such a thing may be constructed from the outputs of previously discovered cells. \ldots If we really knew the answers, for example, we should be able to program them on a computer. But finding a hand-detector certainly did not allow us to program one.

25: 

The choice of an algorithm is influenced for example, by what it has to do and by the hardaware in which it must run. But there is a wide choice available at each level, and the explication of each level involves issues that are rather independent o the other two. 

(Figure 1-4):

Computational theory: What is the goal of the computation, why is it appropriate, and what is the logic of the strategy by which it can be carried out?
Representation and algorithm: How can this computational theory be implemented? In particular, what is the representation for the input and output, and what is the algorithm for the transformation?
Hardware implementation: How can the representation and the algorithm be realized physically?

27:

For example, one favorite is that the brain is quite different from a computer because one is parallel and the other serial. The answer to this, of course, is that the distinction between serial and parallel is a distinction at the level of algorithm; it is not fundamental at all----anything programmed in parallel can be rewritten serially (though not necessarily vice versa). The distinction, therefore, provids no grounds for arguing that the brain operates so differently from a computer that a computer could not be programmed to perform the same tasks.

35 (Elizabeth Warrington):

Warrington's talk suggested two things. First, the representation of the shape of an object is stored in a different place and is therefore a quite different kind of thing from the representation of its use and purpose. And second, vision alone can deliver an internal description of the shape of a viewed object, even when the object was not recognized in the conventional sense of understanding its use and purpose.

re: the principles of neural computation): It is that, if possible the nervous system avoids iterative methods---that is, pure iteration in which no new information is introduced at each cycle. Instead, it seems to prefer one-shot methods \ldots The nervous system also seems to prefer methods that run from the coarse to the fine, doing essentially the same thing at each state but being safved from pure iteration by introducing new information at each cycle. 

107:

Yet cooperative methods (a type of non-linear, iterative algorithm) look very plausible from some points of view \ldots Why, then, are they not used?

One possible explanation may be that cooperative methods take too long and demand too much of the neural hardware to be implemented in any direct way. The problem with iteration is that it demands the circulation of numbers around some kind of loop, which could be carried out by some system of recurrent collaterals or closed loops of neuronal connections. However, unless the numbers involved can be represented quite accurately as they are circulated, errors characteristically tend to build up rather quickly. To use a neuron to represent a quantity with an accuracy even as low as 1 in 10, it is necessary to use a time interval that is sufficiently long to hold between 1 and 10 spikes in comfort. This means at least 50 ms per iteration for a medium-sized cell, which means 200 ms for four iterations---the minimum time ever required for our cooperative algorithm to solve a stereogram. And this is too slow. 

337:

from an information-processing point of view, what is done and why assumes paramount importance \ldots The implementation details don't matter so much from this perspective provided that they do the right thing. 

339:

I cannot really accept that the computational theory is so independent of the other levels. To be precise, I can imagine that two quite distinct theories of a process might be possible. Theory 1 might be vastly superior to theory 2, which may be only a poor man's version in some way, but it could happen that neural nets have no easy way of implementing theory 1 but can do theory 2 very well. Effort would thus be misplaced in an elaborate development fo theory 2.

Unfortunately, problem-solving research has for obvious reseachs tended to concentrate on problems that we understand well intellectually but perform poorly on, like mental arithmetic and cryptarithmetic geometry-theorem proving, or the game of chess----all problems in which humans skills are of doubtful quality and in which good performance seems to rest on a huge base of knowledge and expertise. 

I argue that these are exceptionally good grounds for \emph{not} yet studying how we carry out such tasks.

	Annote = {16: \ldots the fact that some are not found must be due to accidental gaps in the inventory of signs, and cannot be explained by structural laws of the language \ldots
34: \ldots it is necessary to consider the relative frequency of the phonemes in the given position (not the frequency in a text, but the frequency in the material of wrods). In german \emph{j} is not found before \emph{\textopeno i}. This may be due to pure accident, for initial \emph{j} is relatively infrequent compared with other initial consonants, and the diphthong \emph{\textopeno i} is also relatively rare in other combinations. The probability of their occurring together is therefore not very great, and the non-occurrence need not be due to a specific law preventing this particular combination. On the other hand, there does not seem to be a similar explanation of the lack of e.g.~\emph{tl-} in English. And the systematic nature of this gap seems to be corroborated by the lack of \emph{dl-}/. One would probably, on the whole, be more inclined to recognize a law if the occurrence or the non-occurrence can be formulated in terms of phonetically similar groups of phonemes (e.g. dentals, high vowels, etc.) and think of an accidental gap if this is not the case. 
36: In Finnish the only consonants admitted finally are \emph{n}, \emph{r}, \emph{l}, \emph{t}, \emph{s} and initially genuine Finnish words have only one consonant; but medially a great diversity of clusters is found, e.g., \emph{ks}, \emph{rst}, \emph{mp}, etc.
38: It should be possible to verify the validity of the empirical rules concerning the relations between the different parts of the syllable, and of the hierarchy of more or less general laws, established above, by an inquiry into the treatment of loanwords containing combinations of phonemes not occurring in the receiving language. if the non-occurrence was due to an accidental gap, the introduction of the foreign word should not make any difficulties, e.g. the introduction of a word ``\emph{prust}'' in English.},

On grounds of convenience I find distinctive features useful for all sorts of assimilative and dissimilative changes, but awkward for deletoins, insertions and metatheses, where economy of features may sometimes be achieved by extremely counterintuitive devices. },

	Annote = {A description of English will achieve the level of observational adequacy, in this case, if it distinguishes /brink/, as an occurring form, from /blik/ and /bnik/, as non-occurring forms. Thus a lexicon---a list of all occurring forms---meets the level of observational adequacy. It correctly presents the data available to the child, the input of the acquisition model AM. The description will meet the level of descriptive adequacy if it distinguishes /brink/ and /blik/, as admissible forms, from /bnik/, as an inadmissible form. In this case, it will state what the spaekr knows (unconsciously--cf. note 2) to be true; it gives correctly the output of AM. To meet hte level of explanatory adequacy, a linguistic theory must justify the descriptively adequate grammar on internal grounds. That is, it must show on what basis the device AM (for the linguist) selects a grammar admitting /blik/ and excluding /bnik/. 

For example, if the lexicon lists only occurring forms (e.g., /brik/) and the grammar contains rule (1) as a redundancy rule, then this grammar distinguishes the non-occurring but admissible /blik/ from the non-occurring but inadmissible /bnik/ in the following way: there exists a possible but non-occurring distinctive feature matrix which is converted by the phonological rules into /blik/, but there is no possible matrix that is converted by these ruels into /bnik/. Consequently, the rules that generate the forms also make the distinction between admissible and inadmissible, and it is unnecessary to add a new system of rules (an independent phonological grammar) for the grammar to achieve descriptive adequacy, in this respect.},

Abstract away from physical properties and providing analyses in terms of equivalence classes is something that all scientists do, including linguists and other cognitive scientists. In the case of cognitive science, this process of forming equivalence classes actual constitutes the object of study. The human mind/brain automatically filters incoming stimuli in such a way as to collapse even grossly distinct signals and treat them identically.

The human visual system interprets certain stimuli in such a way as to construct a representation of a triangle. In other words, the triangle is not a physical property of the page but a result of how you process physical stimuli like this page under certain circumstances \ldots In other words, your mind imposes the triangle interpretation on the page.

We come now to the basic dialectic. In their capacity as performers, individuals will be concerned with maintaining the impression that they are living up to the many standards by which they and their products are judged. Because these standards are so numerous and so pervasive, the individuals who are performers dwell more than we might think in a moral world. But, \emph{qua} performers, individuals are concerned not with the moral issue of realizing these standards, but with the amoral issue of engineering a convincing impression that these standards are being realized. Our activity, then, is largely concerned with moral matters, but as performers we do not have a moral concern in these moral matters. As performers we are merchants of morality. Our day is given over to intimate contact with the goods we display and our minds are filled with intimate understandings of them; but it may well be that the more attention we give to these goods, the more distant we feel from them and from those who are believing enough to buy them. To use a different imagery, the very obligation and profitability of appearing always in a steady moral light, of being a socialized character, forces us to be the sort of person who is practiced in the ways of the stage. },

	Annote = {747: FORMCODE/LEMMA/SURFACE

Note that an affixed word whose function cannot be entirely predicted from its morphemic constituents would need to be represented at the lemma level. For example, \emph{feathery} is associated with specific informatino that cannot be determined purely from the meaning of its stem \emph{feather} and its suffix \emph{y} (e.g., that it refers to ``lightness'' more than ``feather-like shape'') and therefore a lemma is required for the whole word \emph{feathery} in order to provide a link to that specific semantic information. This, however, does not necessitate the existence of a formal-level representation for the whole word, as it is possible for the lemma of \emph{feathery} to be activated via the form representation for its individual morphemes (i.e., \emph{feather} and \emph{y}). 

In other words, the higher the base frequency, the less the time spent processing the first part of the word (i.e., the stem), while the higher the surface frequency, the less the time spent processing the word further. This is exactly the pattern expected if base frequency influences access to the lemma in the first place, with surface frequency influencing the ease with which the accessed stem information can be combined with the accessed affix information. 

749:

cites Sereno and Jongman 1997 as evidence for "combination even w/ 0s" 

reverse base frequency is from recombination

761:

The reverse base frequency effect attests to the fact that a postdecomposition recombination stage cannot be circumvented simply by falling back on whole-word recognition.

763 (fn. 5):

In fact, the correlation between stem frequency and RT was significant in the reverse direction, r(60) = .26, suggesting that rejection of a nonword was harder when its stem was of higher frequency.},

The basic issue here is the derivational source of the various binyamin---what other forms in the language they appear to be the most closely related to and derived from. This question is very difficult to answer for the first Arabic binyan. It is probably never derived from a verb of some other binyam, but it is usually impossible to say whether some nouns are derived from this binyam or this binyam from the nouns.

316: What is paradoxical in this model of the formation of these denominal nouns is that they form imperfective verbs solely in order to feed the parasitic rules that generate the nomina vasis.

In adult judgements of acceptability, acceptability is directly related to lexical frequency

A specific and very telling problem with separation of the grammar from the lexicon is that it leads to difficulty in characterizing systematically underrepresented but still extant forms. Berkley (1994b) discusses this problem was it manifests itself in OT, in connection with the productivity of affixation. Through detailed study of an on-line English dictionary, she shows that attachment of the suffix "ity" is systematically but not absolutely suppressed on
otherwise eligible stems which end in coronal obstruents.

I view Hammond's solution as undesirable because it provides no insight into the statistical relationship between the low rate of occurrence of such forms and the phonetic properties which gave rise to this low rate. It at best mechanically encodes observations such as
those in Table 1 without treating them as a deep and characteristic regularity of language.},

Why are so many possible words not used in English? One might suspect that there are phonological constraints that rule out most of the disyllabic words, but this is unlikely: there are no known phonological constraints that would rule out 99% of the disyllabic combinations. Rather, the real answer in my view is that a language simply does not need many morphemes, which make up words (Duanmu 2008).

269:

Similarly, English has at least 59 productive onsets, shown in (16)-(19). The distinction between \emph{productive} and \emph{unproductive} onsets is not a technical one. Unproductive onsets mostly include those that only occur with one vowel; for example, Cj and CCj only occur with the vowel [u]. Should we include all onsets in the calculation, the spotty-data problem would be even more serious.

In California, the vowels of \textsc{kit} and \textsc{dress} may undergo lowering, and the vowel of \textsc{trap} may undergo both lowering and backing which results in realizations near [\textesh ], [\ae ], and [a] respectively. Impressionistic descriptions of this trend suggest \emph{six} sounds like \emph{sex}, \emph{sex} like \emph{sax}, and \emph{sax} like \emph{socks}. The lowering appears to be a recent development and may be a change in progress. It was not noted in earlier studies of California English and seems to have come to the attention of linguists only in the mid-1980s. It is reported to be especially characteristic of the speech of young urban women---a pattern that is consistent with its interpretation as an active change. The geographical extent of this woering is not known, but is has been documented in both Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area (see Hagiwara 1997; Luthin 1987). 

The behavior of the lax front vowels in California bears a striking resemblance to a pattern heard north of the border and known as the Canadian shift (see Boberg, this volume). Dialect contact is unlikely to be responsible for this similarity. Rather, the lowering in both varieties seems to stem from a common structural motivation. Both in Calfifornia and across Canada, the \textsc{lot} and \textsc{thought} vowels are merged, and, as described above, the resulting vowel is typically low and quite back. This merger thus provides /\ae / with greater freedom to shift since it can be lowered and retracted into the low central area of vowel space without encroaching on the territory of the \textsc{lot}/\textsc{thought} vowel. When /\ae / shifts, this creates an opening into which /\textesh / may be lowered, which in turn creates an opening into which /\textsci / may lower. In this sense, the development of the lax vowels appears to be a chain shift, specifically a drag chain (see Labov 1994). 

348:

The vowel of \textsc{trap}, \textsc{bath}, and \textsc{dance}, kjonwn as ``short-a'', serves as a distinguishing feature of several American dialects. As noted above, the pattern throughout most of the West and Midwest involves moderate raising of the vowel in the context of a following nasal. In Cincinnati, /\ae / is raised in this environment as well as before fricatives (e.g., \emph{have}, \emph{path}) and /d/ (e.g., \emph{bad}). Phonetically, the raised variants are descirbed as ``tensed'' because they typically involve a peripheral nucleus with an inglide; i.e., [e\textscha]. Similar forms are heard in the Great Lakes region as part of the Northern Cities Shift and along the Atlantic Coast including the cities of Philadelphia and New York (see Gordon, this volume). However, the Cincinnati pattern is distinct from the others in terms of its conditioning. The tense forms appear in a wider range of contexts in Cincinnati speech than in the Mid-Atantic dialects. Raising before voiced fricatives, for example. is very restricted in the East. On the other hand, tensing does not occur in all contexts, a fact that distinguishes Cincinnati speech from that affected by the Northern Cities Shift. Speakers in the Inland North, for example. will typically have raised forms before voiceless stops (e.g., \emph{cat}) and /l/ (e.g., \emph{pal}) while such items appear with a lax [\ae ] in Cincinnati. Actually, the Cincinnati pattern described here is today largely restricted to older speakers and appears to be undergoing change. Younger Cincinnatians seem to be moving towards the general Western pattern in which raising of /\ae / occurs only before nasals.},

We want to be able to understand, for example, the direction of linguistic change or the relationship between form and the grammatical function of a class of signs. We also want to be able to test hypotheses about the relationship between different linguistic and social constraints, to compare alternative analyses, and to create models that allow us to make predictions [annoying guy citation]. To accomplish these goals, we need to go beyond reporting percentages of occurrence or nonoccurence of linguistic forms and use statistical procedures that enable us to model simultaneously the many potential influences on variation."

Some linguists have even maintained that the study of larger clusters will not yield any new significant results because they can all be dissolved into clusters of two consonants---thus C$_1$ C$_2$ C$_3$ can be dissolved into C$_1$ C$_2$ and C$_2$ C$_3$. 

#cons in cluster: 2           3     4   5 6
#different clusts: 231 332 144 21 4

30: But as \emph{\v{z}} is by far the rarest phoneme in the language, this gap may be purely accidental. 

Although my material is drawn from a fairly extensive corpus---all accessible dictionaries and vocabularies, printed texts of tens of thousands of pages as well as ordinary speech---there is every reason to believe, as experience has shown, that additional material would yield new clusters. The material will never be complete. It will always contain accidental gaps, partly because some occurring clusters may have escaped my attention, partyl because some clusters by pure chance do not occur in the vocabulary.

It is therefore to be expected that the proportion of accidental gaps will increase with the number of terms of the cluster. In the class of clusters of two consonants there seem to be very few such gaps, in the clusters of three there are considerably more, and in the still larger clusters probably still more. 

``virtual members of the system''. 

31: The statement that ``\emph{b} does not occur before \emph{k}'' is no such structural rule of distribution, because the two terms of the statement, \emph{b} and \emph{k}, are individual phonemes. The statement that ``\emph{b} does not occur before unvoiced stops'' would on the other hand be considered a distributional rule, since the term unvoiced stops designates a class of phonemes.
32: If we consider that \emph{p b} and \emph{v} are labial stops and that the consonant \emph{v} also contains a labial feature, we may presume that the non-occurrence of the clusters \emph{bv- pv-} and \emph{\.pv-} is structurally determined.
33: We would thus by definition have established four classes of clusters for our descriptive purposes: the class of clusters which do not occur and which do not conform to any structural patterns in the language, called inadmissible clusters; the class of clusters which occur but do not conform to any structural patterns, called marginal clusters; the class of clusters which do not occur, but conform to the structural patterns of the language, called virtual clusters; and finally the class of clusters which occur and conform to certain patterns, called actual clusters. 
34: One can choose to relegate them from the system, because one has from the start some preconceived notion of the nature of the system, or one can include them in the system with the result that the description will be extremely complicated.},

One of the best known real life examples of Simpson's paradox occurred when the University of California at Berkeley was sued for bias against women who had applied for admission to graduate schools there. The admission figures for the fall of 1973 showed that men applying were more likely than women to be admitted, and the difference was so large that it was unlikely to be due to chance.

Applicants	 % admitted
Men	8442	44%
Women	4321	35%
However when examining the individual departments, it was found that no department was significantly biased against women. In fact, most departments had a "small but statistically significant bias in favor of women".

Department	Men	Women
Applicants	 % admitted	Applicants	 % admitted
A	825	62%	108	82%
B	560	63%	25	68%
C	325	37%	593	34%
D	417	33%	375	35%
E	191	28%	393	24%
F	272	6%	341	7%

The research paper by Bickel et al. concluded that women tended to apply to competitive departments with low rates of admission even among qualified applicants (such as in the English Department), whereas men tended to apply to less-competitive departments with high rates of admission among the qualified applicants (such as in engineering and chemistry). 

399:

For a start let us identify those of the 85 [departments] with bias sufficiently large to occur by chance less than five times in a hundred. There prove to be four such departments. The deficit in the number of women admitted to these four (under the assumptions for calculating expected frequencies as give above) is 26. Looking further, we find six departments biased in the opposite direction, at the same probability levels; these account for a deficit of 64 men.

\emph{The proportion of women applicants tends to be high in departments that are hard to get into and low in those that are easy to get into.}},

Why is inflection different from derivation? Traditionally \ldots (a) inflection is paradigmatic, derivation not, (b) inflection is productive, derivation not (c) inflection is transparent,  derivation not (d) inflection creates things that can't be mono-morphemic, derivation creates the same kinds of things (Ns, Vs, As) as mono-morphemes already are

``Paradigmatic'' includes the notion that (a) inflection (a) inflection fills out feature space such that, for example, every noun will have all the case forms it needs to participate fully in the syntax and (b) inflection is typically syncretic such that a single form spreads to fill several cells in paradigmatic space

10:

Languages in which participle forms of verbs are used as substantives (Ns) and modifiers (As) make derivational (category changing) morphology look as paradigmatic as any verbal inflectional morphology.

[how is agentive "form of a verb" different than past tense "form of a verb"]

As shown in (29), to the extent that (some) derivational morphology leaves apparent ``gaps,'' so does syntax and inflectional morphology (for variation reasons, associated with negotiating either the meaning (29e,f) or the pronunciation (29g) at the ``interfaces'' of syntax with PF and LF). 

?goer vs. party-goer
*dier vs. noisy dier (said of an actor)

So the ``paradigmatic'' quality of derivational morphology -- filling of ``cells'', productivity, blocking -- is revealed when we examine heads attaching above little x.

17: object marker (-mu-) never reduplicates though it is at derived at stratum one. i.e., reduplication operates on a subset of the stratum one material
26: -\c{i}re \ldots is marked to trigger stratum two rules. Since height harmony is a stratum one rule, this would explain why forms with -\c{i}re are singled out for not undergoing the height harmony rule. Coalescence followed by liquid deletion must then be treated as stratum two rules because tehy are triggered by -\c{i}re.

Although the above analysis argues for treating -\c{i}re as a stratum two morpheme, notice that it does not explain why this morpheme undrgoes reduplication at stratum one. As argued in Mutaka (1988), stratum two in Kinande is non-cyclic. It consists of the affixation of the INFL morphemes, (i.e. the subject marker and the tense marker) onto the expanded stem. Since the tense marker -\c{i}re is now assumed to be a stratum two morpheme. this means that it would be come available for the stratum two rules after the affixation of the INFL markers. Under this assumption, we would expect the following derivation for the recent past tense of eri-sö-a `to grind.'

\ldots the best way to gain an understanding of the computational system of phonology is to assume that the substance of phonological entities is \emph{never} relevant to how they are treated by the computational system, except in \emph{arbitrary}, \emph{stipulative} way. 

If our goal as generative linguists is to define the set of \emph{computationally possible} human grammars, ``universal tendencies'' are irrelevant to that enterprise. We propose extending the Saussurean notion of the arbitrary nature of the linguistic signs to the treatment of phonological representations by the phonological computational system. Phonology is not and should not be grounded in phonetics since the facts that phonetic grounding is meant to explain can be derived without reference to \emph{phonology}.

The onstraint' could never be violated since no grammatical morphemes in the language begin with /p/. Therefore, there is no reason whatsoever to posit a transsyllabic constraint against -kp- since the nature of the Hungarian lexicon assures that it never arises, except in compounds.

More accurately, clusters straddling such boundaries provide evidence that the interconstituent constraints do not exist at all. This somewhat negative view is supported by the fact that, according to S+T, /kp/ is actually found in ten monomorphemic words (page 129: Table 17).

[no evidence from loan phonology]

It should also be noted that S+T suggest that there is a constraint against /kp/ clusters within a morpheme or across a close juncture, but there is no constraint against -gb-.},

Morpheme Integrity Constraint (MIC): Mapping of a melody to a reduplicative template takes place \emph{by morpheme}. If the whole of a morpheme cannot be successfully mapped into the bisyllabic reduplicative template, then none of the morpheme may be mapped.

in verbs, the pre-stem is not available for copying

a pre-stem nasal is never copied in verb reduplication (solved via allomorph selection)

true also of monosyllablic stems

88:

-VCV- undergo double reduplication

89:

the input to reduplication consists syllabification with an onset and least one vowel making a syllable

91:

in the case of verbs with \emph{derived} polysyllabic stems, reduplication is always possible

-CVC-extension-FV -> -CVC-a-CVC-extension-FV

CV with extensions argue that extension cannot be infixes: -CV-extension-FV -> -CV-extension-a-CV-extension-FV

92:

in CVC, extension can't be mapped to reduplication template (by virtue of the MIC)

93:

with both applied and reciprocal, left-to-right mapping

claim that [a] is a default vowel, not the FV

FV reduplicates in subjunctive

94:

but when you insert an extension, [a] returns

derived -VCVCVC stems:

e-ri.oh-er-a -> e-ri.oh-er-a-h-er-a
e-ri.es-er-an-a -> e-ri.es-er-a-s-er-a

therefore initial V is extraprosodic (but this isn't true of VCV stems)

98:

-u- passive can fill out a CVC template, but stays put otherwise
-i- causative can fill out a CVC template, and may go w/ larger units too ["not productive"], even if there is an intervening reciprocal

100:

final vowels associated w/ certain tense/aspect combos can bleed -i- reduplication

105:

frozen suffixes

107:

77 polysyllables that do not reduplicate, because the suffix is frozen
29 complex internal structure, despite lack of base forms
108 the whole stem just reduplicates

108:

This solution would be very unfortunate, since it would amount to saying that these forms, the largest of the three classes, are irrelevant to the rest of what is going on in Kinande reduplication. 

This is that \emph{none} of the verbs in (75) can reduplicate if one of the productive suffixes are added to them. 

e-ri-bugul-ir-a (no redup)
e-ri-gambul-ir-a (no redup)
e-ri-bindul-ir-a (no redup)

e-ri-bugul-w-a (no redup)
e-ri-gambul-w-a (no redup)
e-ri-bindul-w-a (no redup)

shows that it is the \emph{presence} rather than the \emph{shape} of the additional suffix that makes reduplication impossible. 

In other words, if we assume that the stem \emph{gamb-ul-a} exceptionally allows accessbility to the internal structure so that \emph{-ul-} can be truncated [?] and still satisfy the MIC, once the applied \emph{-ir-} is added, this internal structure [ [ gamb ] ul ] is no longer available. 

fn. 30:

variation in three of the "29":

e-ri-gos-o/a-gosol-a
e-ri-henge-a/e-hengem-a
e-ri-sol-o/a-solom-a

It is not sufficent to use the fact that the applied stem is one syllable longer than the applied stem. CUZ:

The passive suffix \emph{-u-} glides to [w] before a following vowel and hence does not add a suffix to the stem. 

reduplication is still not possible when passive [w] is added to stems of three or more syllables

Work by Vitevitch, Luce, and colleagues \citep{Vitevitch1997,Vitevitch1998,Vitevitch1999,Vitevitch2004} suggests that speakers are aware that clusters which cannot occur in English monomorphemes when processing speech, specifically in segmenting words into morphemes \citep[cf.][et seq.]{Taft1975}. Attempting to synthesize this result into her model of gradient decomposition, Hay provides a treatment of this result in terms of a phonological preprocessor whose output is fed forward to the decomposition system. Crucially, her model does not require these phonotactic rankings to somehow persist.

- hypothesis that /t/-thing is implementation
- and "stored boundary" / morpheme boundary clear
- stronger base word identity (greater storage) supports /t/

191:

If, on the other hand, a derived word tends towards whole-word access, then the identity of the base word is not important for recognition.

Note that the predictions put forward here run directly counter to independent predictions about the degree of reduction of the base words, when not suffixed. Frequent words tend to be more reduced in production [citations omitted]. It follows, then, that the implementation fo \emph{soft} should be more reduced than the implementation of \emph{swift}, when produced as simple words. The prediction we are making then is a particularly powerful one, because it predicts that this trend will \emph{reverse} when these words are suffixed with \emph{-ly}. If this is so, it will provide powerful new evidence about the nature of complex words, and the consequences of decomposability for production.

\emph{diligent(ly)}, 
\emph{frequent(ly)},

[are there non-possible words?]

However, members of a speech community display remarkable agreement about which affixes can be used in which contexts to create new words (Aronoff 1980). It is not the case, for example, that \emph{-th} is fully productive for some speakers, and nonproductive for others. [why does this matter] Surely knowledge of possible words in one's language, then is an aspect of the ``nature of linguistic knowledge''. The question of where this knowledge comes from is an important one, and answers have proved elusive.},

243: counterfunctional effects would be hard to find, but could be inferred historically, no?
246: Hence, even though the \textsc{produced} corpus may contain violations of the DC, misconstrual leaves a \textsc{perceived} corpus without violations! In the complete absense of other disambiguating information, `smooth' miscommunication will occur, with marked categories intended, and unmarked categories perceived, and the hearers will be under the impression that the DC is true.

Since they will not perceive violations of distinctiveness, they will systematically, in all languages at all times, be trying to construct grammars in which the DC is true. I hypothesis that principles of UG (the autonomous, modular organization of the mental language faculty) do not permit the construction of direct functional constraints on variability. Instead, child learners will constantly try to construct formal devices that fulfill the perceived necessary functions. In the coronal stop and -S deletion cases this is achieved with a boundary constraint.

There is another, more subtle motive of no less importance. This is the striving towards unification and simplification of the premises of the theory as a whole (i.e., Mach's principle of economy, interpreted as a logical principle). 

The metaphysicist believes that the logically simple is also the real. The tamed metaphysicist believes that not all that is logically simple is embodied in experienced reality, but that the totality of all sensory experience can be `comprehended' on the basis of a conceptual system bilt on premises of great simplicity. },

13: view of ``replacement'' and ``rejection''

41f: For example, it is possible that a particular child might never have heard the plural \emph{formulae} of \emph{formula}, thus storing the noun with no lexical exception feature, in spite of the fact that all of the child's sources had the irregular plural for this noun. 

Secondly, in real-time production, an adult may fail to access a lexical exception feature (apparently). Thus, although they have \emph{formula} stored with an indication that it makes an irregular plural, \emph{formulae}, in real-time production they may produce a form which the speaker would normally identify as a ``speech error'. Since normally the form produced in such a situation involves default morphology for that lexical clsas (thus, in our example, \emph{formulas}), the speech-error form will be parsable and seem well-motivated.

93: For example, phonological constrasts in vowel length are possible, as are allophonic vowel lengthening, so both input representations and output representations [in figure 6.1] can contain a representational specification for length. However, the representation capacity available to human languages appears to be quite limited in this domain, no human language offering us evidence which would lead us to conclude that human phonologies can have 10 or 20 or 2,000 different ``lengths'' for represented segments. By contrast, if one measures with sufficiently precise instruments the lengths of the medial segment in 10, 20, or even 2,000 actual articulations of ``cat'' by some speaker, one will discover that vowel lengths differ as a factual matter virtually across the board, each utterance of ``cat'' showing a (perhaps slightly, but nevertheless measurable) difference in vowel length. We thus clearly need to distinguish between the output representation of phonological computation and impressionistic rendering of the actual articulations of forms. 

98: historical missing of phonemization

111: That is, an acquirer has misparsed nasalization triggered by universal properties of human articulatiory implementation as being due rather to an explicit command to nasalize -- acquires attribute such ``explicit commands'' to the phonetic representation (which is, after all, what articulatory schema normally implement during speech). Thus a low-level, universal aspect of speech planning and/or production has been elevated to the status of a phonological rule. 

133: \emph{Paradebeispiele} [plural, singular \emph{Paradebespiel}

135: idea that hypercorrection derives diffusion

141: Indeed, it appears that the diachronic filter, which, as simple laboratory experiments on the confusion matrices generated by perceptual testing reveals, favors some misanalyses over others (rather than absolutely precluding disfavorted misparsings), is the reason why most claims about ``naturalness'' and ``markedness'' are statistical, rather than absolute claims.

	Annote = {17: Perhaps it is not surprising that strikingly different regularities emerge under different descriptions of events, and consequently that the descriptions suitable for stating the regularities of phsyics, chemistry, and biology are unsuitable for stating the regularities of cognitive psychology.
35: One way in which this emergence is exhibited is that at one level of description, the principles of operation of a system may be compatible with a much wider range of behaviors than actually occurs. For example, the laws of physics are compatible with the existence of all the observed types of creatures as well as an indefinite number that do not exist. Why does only this subset exist?
55: Very few of the physically discriminable properties of the machine are relevant to its computational function.
65: No such regularities can be captured if the rules must be stated over either unanalyzed whole utterances or sounds described in acoustical terms. 
85: Without the distinction between \emph{performance} theory and what Chomsky calls \emph{competence} theory \ldots we could find ourselves [in modeling psychological behavior--KG] simply mimicking the most frequent behavior rather than inferring the underlying mechanisms. 
87: Meeting a friend in a corridor, Wittgenstein said: ``Tell me, why do people always say it was \emph{natural} for men to assume the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating?'' His friend said, ``Well, obviously, because it just \emph{looks} as if the sun is going round the earth.'' To which the philosopher replied, ``Well, what would it have looked like if it had looked as if the earth was rotating?'' (Tom Stoppard, \emph{Jumpers})
108: (newell and simon 1972, p186)

It may be that the analysis has gone too far---is too \emph{disaggregated} \ldots Excessive disaggregation woudl reveal itself in the capriciousness of various selections, viewed in terms of the local context, whenever the next action was in fact (but not explicitly) determined by the structure of the higher-level plan or method. 

141: There must be an interface between semantically interpreted symbols and physical properties; that's what perception is.

151: In other words, its \emph{computationally relevant} states are a tiny subset of its physically discriminable states.

152: There can be no disputing that a term such as /b/ describes a \emph{physical} event as surely as the term ``550 Hertz''

160: Contrary to a common misconception, the fact that our perceptual resolution is limited along certain dimensions does not demonstrate that the input magnitude is quantized into a finite set of categories by our transducers. Limited sensory discriminability does not entail that a fixed number of sensory magnitudes is encoded, and hence, is cognitively distinguishable. The mere fact that two stimulus magnitudes, $S_1$ and $S_2$, are separated by less than one just-noticeable-difference (\emph{jnd})---and hence, are pairwise perceptually indiscriminable---does not mean they are indistinguishable in \emph{every} way to the cognitive system. For example, in a limited resolution system, as opposed to a truly quantized one, there will always be a third magnitude, $S_3$, such that, whereas $S_1$ and $S_3$ are pairwise indiscriminable, $S_2$ and $S_3$ can be pairwise discriminated. This shows that $S_1$ and $S_2$ behave differently in some situations; hence, they are not cognitively indistinguishable, and must have distinct, cognitive representations. The same is true for all pairs of values of $S_1$ and $S_2$ down to the finest grain, where real neural quantization presumably holds. 

165: ``Tranducer inputs must be stated in the laws of physics''
233: \ldots it is crucial that we note the difference between the following two tasks:

1a. Solve a problem by using a certain prescribed form of representation or a certain medium or mechanism, and
1b. Attempt to re-create as accurately as possible the sequence of perceptual events that would occur if you were [sic] actually observed a certain real event happening.

258: A cognitive description would refer to stimulus conditions in terms of how people interpret (or \emph{take}) them. 
263: It has been fairly commonplace to say, ever said Plato first said it, that we must endeavor to ``carve nature at her natural joints.''
268: My point here is that mere specificity of environmental cause is no more reason to believe that the cognitive state attained is learned than is the effect of sunlight on skin color reason to believe that suntans are learned; something more is required to show that learning is involved. What is needed is a demonstration that the cognitive state is reached because environmental conditions have provided the organism with certain information about things in the world, information from which the organism can inver belifs whose content is related to those conditions.},

I think, in fact, that we can see that traditional usage of the notion of defectivity requires that a clear majority of some class of items behave in some specifiable way; with such a regularity as a backdrop, sporadic exceptions to it may be termed defective. Thus no English grammarian would ever say that the verb \emph{be} is defective, in that it exhibits more contrasts in person-marking than any other verb, let alone saying that all other verbs in English are defective in not making as many distinctions as to be does. Thus defectivity is clearly seen as being reserved for the few and freaky.},

More generally, since (.) occurs in every candidate set in the null parse approach, it determines a fixed Harmony threshold for the entire language: (.) wins every competition in which the best alternative has lower Harmony.

We should hardly care for van Oostendorp's informal claim that for him, repetition improves these forms, given the careful and sophiscated work on repetition effects on grammaticality judgements \citep{Nagata1988,Nagata1989a,Nagata1989d}.

This constraint is not absolutely surface true for Dutch, however. Certain suffixes, such as the comparative, verbal inflection, or one allomorphy of the nominal plural, do not seem to be subject to it. 

What is more, even the diminutive suffix itself does not always obey the constraint

83:

Furthermore, it seems we are dealing with a type of derived environment effect.

This also means that the winner candidate in (24) is not a diminutive, even though its input is (and the diminutive suffix is still hanging around in the output).

It is important to note that this literature is embedded in work in language variation: the grammar can generate more than one output, of which there are certain less preferred ones. 

[``preferred'' is being used here in two senses! Is one more or less grammatical, or more or less used! to use a clear example, the French of Montreal has "ne" omitted in "pas" clauses at a very high rate, but no one to my knowledge has claimed one is more or less grammatical! this error is so elementary that it should have not been permitted to stand]

If this is the state of the art in understanding the (very real) status of ineffability, for instance, I fear that we may be building a linguistics of task-specific psychology, constructed of invalid data, and needlessly parochial with regards to formal matters: ``turles all the way down''. This volume is evidence much more work is needed. 

Though a few authors demonstrate a very interesting behavior: they include links to PDFs of nearly all articles they can, including ones appearing in both journal and paper collections (which may be technically in violation of copywrite, depending on the journal's policy and whether the articles are pre- or post-prints)

1:

The papers here collected here focus on cases that fail --- cases in which no movement or manipulation is invoked to create a grammatical output for some particular input. 

We emphasize that the cases under consideration easily \emph{could} be rescued. A little spreading here, a deletion there, and the inputs could be rendered well-formed. But they aren't. 

2:

The architecture of OT makes the problem of ungrammaticality particularly clear. 

Cases in which some input seemingly has no output challenge the very core of the model. 

The second aspect of OT which makes clear the need to explicitly model ungrammaticality is the presence and role of violable constraints in the model. Well-formedness --- or, grammaticality --- as modeled with OT is anisomorphic [lacks a true isomorph--KG]  with constraint satisfaction. 

[typo]

3:

The need to model ungrammaticality explicitly is emphasized by the fact that all grammatical outputs violate some constraint.

[note that this is not necessarily so, just practically]

Because the grammatical output associated with any input is imperfect, it becomes particularly striking that some inputs have no outputs. 

[annoying:] The existence of such phenomena is a confrontation[sic?] of the architectural structure of OT.

[typo]

The study of absolute ungrammaticality is an untilled field in derivational approaches to modeling phonological behavior. 

Since the cases presented in this book are, as noted, cases in which a solution is easily imagined, derivational approaches will have to prevent that solution from applying. 

4:

If a structural description is such that a rule of repair does not apply, what happens then? Either the derivation must be stopped, modeling a crashed derivation [requiring a means for phonology to "crash"--KG], or the ungrammatical form makes its way through the derivation, only to be controlled for wel-formedness as part of the final packaging prior to delivery to the phonetics. 

A derivational approach to phonology must therefore be enchanced with constraints on outputs. [this oh-so-does not follow]

[and an incorrect, albeit common, means of citing papers as people.]

6:

However, when a root ends in consonant cluster[sic] with rising sonority, there may be a gap for the imperative.

7: 

The claim above that the imperatives in (5) are unutterable is somewhat imprecise because these imperatives do in fact surface when they are followed by a vowel-initial word. This fact is taken here as evidence that speakers do indeed master the morphology of these words. 

10:

If spell-out in syntax draws from the lexicon, ineffable forms must be stored there, at least in the Norwegian case. 

A theory which reduces phonological to a mere \emph{interpretative} component would thereby seem to fundamentally underappreciate the role of the phonological component in the determination of grammaticality.

First, by eliciting judgements, we can examine reactions to sentence types that might occur only very rarely in spontaneous speech or recorded corpora. This is a standard reason for performing experiments in social science---observational study does not always provide a high enough concentration of the phenomena we are most interested in.
Fn 1 [this doesn't follow, but observes]: On the production side, it is difficult to induce a subject to produce precisely the sentence one wishes to study without actually exposing the subject to the sentence. On the comprehension side, it is hard to discover anything about the nature, or even the success or failure, of the comprehension process without eliciting some additional reaction, such as a judgement.
12 [discussing a case where two papers disagree about the grammaticality of a certain pattern of coreference, where six examples of the relevant construction could be located]:
``How do we interpret this data? Do we cheer bcause there \emph{were} six examples and conclude that Reinhart was right? Or do we boo because there were \emph{only} six examples, as against hundreds of the uncontroversially good type?\ldots We may have a good but (accidentally) rare construction; or we may have a bad construction occuring a few times because of errors'' (Carden and Dietrich 1981, p.~591)
[it is informative that Carden and Dietrich \emph{do} find that speakers do not accept these readings anymore than uncontroversially bad sentences]
14: In my view, we should start from the position that the entire behavior of making grammaticality judgements is the result of interactions between primary language faculties of the mind and general cognitive properties, and crucially does \emph{not} involve special components dedicated to linguistic intuition. Thus, my hypothesis is that for any effect of a language (judgement) task, there could be an analogous effect on a similar nonlinguistic cognitive (judgement) task. 
(This is quite similar to Valian's (1982) claim that the data of more traditional psychological experiments have all the same problems that judgement data have.)
28: [clear case]
32: Kroch (1981) argues that possible grammar-based acccounts of the distribution of such resumptive pronouns are unappealing, and takes this as a reason to consider a processing account in terms of on-line production, which he argues is more straightforward and hence is to be preferred. On this account, resumptive pronouns are the result of the generator's inability to look far enough ahead to determine that the trace of an already uttered \emph{wh}-expression is within an island. Thus, the production mechanism is forced to produce ungrammatical sentences in some cases, and this fact somehow renders them more acceptable than otehr ungrammatical sentences, for reasons that are not entirely obvious. (Examples like this motivate a link between the generator and the jugement routine in the model presented in section 6.2). While this argument for attributing judgements to performance rather than to competence is theory-internal, it makes empirical predictions, for instance that carefully planned speech or writing will not contain sentences like (3a) at all; the astute reader will find a counterexample to this claim in footnote 17. 
A third possibility we must consider when deciding the grammaticality status of a sentence is that it might have no status at all. This possibility is raised by Morgan (1972), who presents unquantified data on interspeaker judgement differences to show that certain pathological cases of subject-verb agreement in English displays a large degree of variation and uncertainty.
[example]
Morgan speculates that this variation might exist because speakers' grammars simply do not contain a rule elaborate enough to apply in such cases, so when forced to make judgements they may apply ad hoc strategies. It is hard to see what the general criteria for reaching this conclusion of grammatical indeterminancy might be. Morgan's argument is based on the inability to find plausible grammatical principles that cover all the judgements that are firm, plus the fact that many speakers find \emph{neither} variant of the problematic sentences grammatical. Presumably, indeterminacy is distinguished in principle from mere interspeaker grammar differences if individual speakers seem not to have systematic judgement patterns, but what constitutes a systematic pattern is not always obvious a priori
41f: discussion of Belletti and Rizzi's ridiculous stars
43: But there is no general theory of which principles \emph{should} cause worse violations. The notion of relative and absolute badness of particular violations is ad hoc, and used in just those cases where it is convenient. 
47(f): Two things are noteworthy in Browning's account. First, as we have seen before, there is a standard rating for constructions of a particular type, independent of the sentences themselves. This is surely a huge idealization --- there are experiments showing that identical structural violations are given different grammaticality ratings depending on their particular lexical content (see sections 5.3.5 and 5.3.6). 
Second, Browning's analysis is another example of equating the badness of sentences and taking this as support for a common violation. But is it not possible that two different principles could yield the same degree of ungrammaticality when violated? Just because two sentences are equally bad does not mean they violate exactly the same constraint(s), especially since most of GB's constraints have yet to be rated according to seriousness. 
48: In the introspectionist paradigm, established by Wilhelm Wundt in 1879 in the first experimental psychology laboratory, trained subjects were asked to describe their impressions of a wide variety of physical objects and experiences (Wundt 1896; Boring 1953). The idea was to describe internal experience in terms of elementary sensations. That is, rather than saying that one sees a book, one should relate the colors, shapes, etc., that are perceived. There were several problems with this approach. 
Another was the fact that Wundt's subjects were far from naive with regard to the experimental procedure. They had to undergo at least 10,000 supervised practice trials before they could be used in an experiment, during which time they were taught special terminology in which to describe their sensations. One cannot help but suspect that Wundt's own ideas on what experience was like affected subjects during this training period. 
[on introspectionist approaches and ericcson and simon]
In a nutshell, they are not taken as facts about the inner workings of subjects' minds, but are studied from the point of view of understanding how it was that subjects were able to say what they did about a mental process, independent of its veraity. This distinction is too easily overlooked, but it is crucial, and many linguists have not taken heed of it yet. Except in those cases where they fail to suit the linguist's purpose, subject's intuitions \emph{are} taken to reflect their true linguistic knowledge. 
61: We know that use of a construction does not imply acceptance and vice versa (Greenbaum 1976a), and that sociolinguists have long known that speakers might deny using forms that they actualy use frequently in everyday speech. As Labov (1975) demonstrates, this phenomenon is not even limited to socially significant linguistic variables. He describes numerous subjects who used positive \emph{anymore} in recorded conversations, yet when asked directly, they claimed never to have heard it, felt that it is not English, misinterpreted its meaning, and showed other signs of bewilderment. Labov points out that ``this puts us in the somewhat embarassing position of knowing more about a speaker's grammar than he does himself'' (p.~35). 
62: One the other hand, it is clear that \emph{judgements} of grammaticality come in more degrees, and in many cases these represent genuined multivalued phenomena (see below). Even in as early a work as \emph{The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory}, Chomsky asserts that ``there is little doubt that speakers can fairly consistently order new utterances, never previously heard, with respect to their degree of `belongingness' to the language'' (p.~132). How are we to reconcile scalar judgemetns with an underlying dichotomy? Is it that the grammar assigns degrees of status to strings after all, and judgements simply reflect these? Or is it that the judgement process itself that maps two-valued grammaticality to scalar acceptability by factoring in behavioral variables? 
[or: behavioral variables intervene in the mapping to scalar acceptability]

G. Lakoff (1973) summarizes the conclusions of this line of research as follows:

	(i) Rules of grammar do not simply apply or fail to apply: rather they apply to a degree
	(ii) Grammatical elements are not simply members or nonmembers of grammatical categories; rather they are members to a degree.
	(iii) Grammatical constructions are not simply islands or non-islands; rather they may be islands to a degree.
	(iv) Grammatical constructions are not simply environmnets or non-environments for rules; rather they may be environments to a degree. 
	(v) Grammatical phenomena form hierarchies which are largely constant from speaker to speaker, and in many cases, from language to language. 
	(vi) Different speakers (and different languages) will have different acceptability thresholds along these hierarchies. (p.~271)

Lakoff continues, ``We are saying that fuzzy grammar has a mental reality. The judgements that people make, which are matters of degree, are functions, perhaps algebraic functions, of unconscious mental judgements, which are also matters of degree'' (p.~286).
[compare embick 2009]
66: One cannot coherently speak of a cline from well-formed to ill-formed without a clear conception of what these are. (p.~57)
One can certainly speak coherently of a continuum, e.g., from rich to poor, without there being any non-arbitrary dividing line between the two. 
Although Chomsky already assumed in \emph{LSLT} that there were degrees of ungrammaticality, he went further in \emph{Aspects} (pp.~148--53), proposing that the grammar predicts at least three levels or kinds of deviance, corresponding to the violation of selectional restrictions, subcategorization, and lexcial category requirements. It is important to recognize that Chomsky's theory assumes the existence of absolute ungrammaticality. Sentences that violate no constraints of the grammar are assumed to be uniformly grammatical. If a sentence is less than absolutely grammatical, it must violate some constraint(s) of the grammar, and these constraints come in varying degrees of importance. Thus there are no degrees of grammaticality, but there are degrees of ungrammaticality. 
67: As G. Lakoff (1987) reminds us, Rosch herself never suggested that graded classification effects reflect degrees of category membership or representation in terms of prototypical features or exemplars. In fact, empirical demonstrations to the contrary have been made. [discussion of Armstrong et al.]
68: Armstrong, Gleitman, and Gleitman do not see these results as contradictory, because their experiment involved two different tasks, judging exemplariness and deciding membership. 
Thus it appears that graded structure in prototype tasks tells us nothing about the nature of the underlying mental representations. Is the same true of graded structure in grammaticality judgements and its' bearing on mental grammar?
77: 

if you have too few levels, people collapse true distinctions arbitrarily. Thus the ``true'' number of distinctions will show the greatest consistency within (and perhaps also between) subjects. It follows that studies that choose inappropriate numbers of levels add spurious variation to their results, possibly concealing the effects they are supposed to uncover. As far as I am aware, a psychometric investigation along these lines has never been done with specific regard to grammaticality judgements. 

Even if we can find the optimal size of rating scale, there will still be problems with this measure of grammaticality judgements. One major problem is how to quantify inter- and intrasubject consistency, which is an important part of much work in this field. If we use a 20-point scale, should we require two subjects to give exactly the same rating in order to consider them consistent? Would plus or minus one position be sufficient? What if two subjects show exactly the same distances between ratings of multiple sentences, but their absolute ratings are offset by some constant? Can we merely say that one is biased twoards more conservative or more liberal judgements, and consider their responses to be fully consistent? Depending on the size of the offset constant, that might not seem appropriate, but neither would a conclusion of total inconsistency. If we standardize means and standard deviations, can we be sure we are not throwing away real differences? [fn. 21: In doing so, we would be implicitly adopting the theoretical position that any such differences simply are not part of what we are studying. For instance, the fact that Speaker A could be consistently more conservative in grammaticality judgements than Speaker B does not tell us anything about their grammars. I do not think we are in a position to say this with any degree of certainty. See Cowart 1995 for more on the use of standard scores.] Similar problems arise if some subjects simply fail to use the whole range of the scale, which can easily happen unintentionally if subjects have no idea what range of sentence types they will see. (For this reason alone, practice trials with representative anchor sentences are a good idea.) If we are attempting to compare consistency of subjects between studies that use different rating scales, the consistency measure will have to be scaled accordingly. 

79: [relative judgements: Hindle and Sag find relative judgement ranking paradoxes]
87: [intersperse dummy trials]
89: Even if our linguistic intuitions are consistent, there is no reason to believe that they are \emph{direct} behavioral reflections of linguistic knowledge. 
138f.: [repeated judgement tasks]
173: Bever's strongest argument for his position is based on the existence of two types of sentence that seem to presuppose mismatches between (psycho)grammatical status and processing status. Some sentences are unusable yet intuitively well-formed (e.g., multiply center-embedded ones), while otehrs are usable or comprehensible but intuitively ill-formed. While acknolwedging that psychogrammar is redundant for adults, since the production and perception mechanisms are fullly capable of performing the mapping between ideas and utterances, Bever argues that the psychogrammar plays an important rule in acquisition, namely to bootstrap the two performance systems, to keep them roughly consistent, and to record accumulated knowledge until it is incorporated in the processing procedures. When acquisition is far enough advanced, the psychogrammar may uncouple from everyday linguistic performance altogether, leading to the mismatches mentioned above. 
199 [fn. 20]: Chomsky (personal communication) believes that variation has always been taken serious in linguistic theory. 
200f.: Labov (1975) has proposed a widely cited set of working principles for dealing with variation in grammaticality judgements and interpreting their relationship to the grammar:

	I. The Consensus Principle: if there is no reason to think otherwise, assume that the judgements of any native speaker are characteristic of all speakers of the language.
	II. The Experimenter Principle: if there is any disagreement on introspective judgements, the judgements of those who are familiar with the theoretical issues may not be counted as evidence. 
	III. The Clear Case Principle: disputed judgements should be shown to include at least one consistent pattern in the speech community or be abandoned. If different judgements are said to represent different dialects, enoguh investigation of each dialect should be carried out to show that each judgement is a clear case in that dialect. (p.~31)
	IV. The Principle of Validity: when the use of language is shown to be more consistent than introspective judgements, a valid description of the language will agree with that use rather than introspections. (p.~40)

Principle I is intended to allow the field to continue without having to resort to experimental verification of sentences whose (un)grammatical status no one has ever questioned. Principle II is intended to guard against experimenter effects; I suggest strengthening it so that the investigating linguists' own intuitions are \emph{never} counted as evidence, even if their data have not be disputed.[footnote omitted] Principle IV jibes well with my comments in chapter 3 concerning the potential for differences between use and intuitions. Unfortunately, tehre is still no way of knowing when primary data from linguistic use need to be sought out (since such relevant data are often not immediately available), and there is no obvious procedure for determining whether they are more consistent than judgement data. But the major problem comes with Principle III. Its wording (and that of Principle I) indicates that Labov is interested in accounting for the grammar of \emph{groups} of speakers \ldots but I have aruged that it is entirely possible for \emph{individuals} to have unique grammars, so that discarding judgements that are shared by other speakers could involve throwing away real data.

Despite the many successes achieved in OT, we are not convinced that the link between phonotactics and alternation is as tight as the theory claims. In fact, not all alternations solve phonotactic problems.

We suggest that the proper link between alternations and phonotactics is at the level of language learning: knowing the phonotactics makes it easier for the language learner to discover alternations. Thus, for example, an English-learning child who already knew the principle of voicing agreement in final obstruent clusters would be in a good position to understand and analyze the voicing alternation in the plural suffix (Albright and Hayes 2002, Hayes 2004, Prince and Tesar 2004).},

An enumeration of these ``elsewhere'' environments would be complex and would miss the point that the totality of ``elsewhere'' environments is exactly the complement of the cases in which [the more specific rule] applies.

[T]here is a rather different way of looking at the disjunctive relationship between these \ldots rules: we have here a \emph{general} case \ldots which is limited by a \emph{special} case. 

We might  say, then, that it is this general/special relationship which constitutes the required condition K which induces disjunctive ordering. We can state the condition more precisely as in (4):

94:

The relation of disjunctive ordering is obviously not one which needs an ad hoc specification for each pair of rules between which it holds. 

100:

In a theory that includes the Elsewhere Condition, on the other hand, the application of these rules is disjunctive, thereby eliminating the ``fake'' intermediate stage in the derivation which causes the problem in the conjunctive mode of application We have, then, additional evidence in favor of the Elsewhere Condition. A noteworthy feature of this example is that the rejected solutions do not ``miss a generalization'' of any kind insofar as the formal regularties of the system are concerned; both conjunctive and disjunctive ordering are fully adequate to ``capture the regularities'' inherent in the data. 

Conjunctive ordering is wrong here not because it fails to ``capture'' a generalization but because it represents the generalization in the wrong way, namely, by requiring a stage in phonological derivations which \ldots has no psychological reality. 

101: 

\citet{Anderson1969}, \citet{Johnson1970}, and \citet{Howard1972} have argued---convincingly, I think---that simultaneous application of rules is not the appropriate convention; rather, rules apply iteratively to their own output. Johnson shows that this iterative application must be constrained in a left-to-right or right-to-left direction so taht the rule ``eats'' its way rightward or leftward in a word. },

At first blush such an approach seems inadequate, as without amplification it cannot account for the fact that irregulars usually occur in patterns, such as cling - clung, fling - flung, sling - slung. There is evidence\ldots{}that such patterns are partly productive, so a pure-listing account fails to capture the native speaker's knowledge.

(generalizations about BN+ stems: height effect, count effect

(The idea is that where forms occur in free variation, we can measure their relative frequencies by counting the hits returned for each.)

Concerning why there should be an overall frontness preference, we offer the following conjecture. For reasons we do not understand, there is a weak connection in the Hungarian lexicon between stem frequency and frontness: the rarer the stem, the more likely it is to take front suffixes. Thus, we find that within just the BN stems, the correlation of the frequency of the bare stem (which we also measured in the Google survey) with the proportion of back responses is r = .141. [FOOTNOTE: This connection might explain \ldots that younger children tend to give backer responses in wug testing for the relevant word classes. Younger children would be less likely to be familiar with rarer words.] Wug stems are, by definition, the rarest of stems (frequency zero), and this may have contributed to their front-preferring behavior. In principle, this factor could be entered into the model described below, but we will not attempt to do this here.

These models share some of the insights that distinguish Connectionism, but abstract away (quite literally) from the representational (and, if they are taken as plausible cognitive models, neurobiological) hardware. 

Namely, there is a sole mechanism (``single route'') by which inflection is generated, but there are no explicit rules or schemata involved in generating the data. 

Further, since the hypothesis space is only constrained by combinations of (subsets of) feature vectors, the scope of a ``generalization'' is not limited by the representations posited by generative linguists, which enforce locality in multiple levels. 

Unlike connectionist models, inference is probabilistic; hypothesed are scored. Because of these two properties, what would appear to a generative linguist to simply be a static description of the data (because the generationalization is non-locality, or has exceptions that cannot be stated in a declarative rule component, e.g., via disjunctive bleeding) can play an important role in the model's predictions. },

It should be noted, though, that in order for a child to make this kind of mistake in the first place, it must be the case that he is either not aware of or is ignoring the other forms of the paradigm which could show that the word in question is not in fact a member of the same class as other words with the same nominative singular. For example, the separate identity of the OE \emph{u}-nouns is revealed clearly by the genitive and dative singular, as well as by the nominative and accusative plural, even after the loss of the final \emph{u}; yet these forms were ignored. 
That many forms are ignored by language learners is a fact that must be considered with respect to the learnability of grammars. What is interesting in this regard about the cases discussed above is precisley the fact that they involve no great difficulties of learnability, no questions of abstractness or opacity, no controversial properties of mind, and so on; and still the reanalysis occurred. 

Bybee and Brewer conclude, mistakenly we believe, that these facts must be represented directly in the grammar [we could say Albright concludes mistakenly that they must be learned].

`false analogy': kiparsky denies instantaneous acquisition, but we can just say the data is far more incomplete than we realize! 

159:

If the effects of earlier stages of acquisition are limited in the ways suggested above, we may be able to look at the problem in a different way. Rather than relaxing the idealization of instantaneous acquisition, we may instead relax another assumption, that of the homogeneity of the data. Thus, what we need to say in order to acount for declension shifts is that some data counts more than others. [just say frequency goddamnit!]},

``The reason that the modals cannot appear in tenseless clauses as infinitives or participles is simply that they have peculiarly defective paradigms; and when a syntactic context is set up that would demand the insertion of one of the missing forms, the whole derivation is blocked.''

''There is independent evidence that derivations must be blocked in this way. Consider the facts in 54, taken from Napoli (1975:841), and credited there to Dorothy Siegel:

(54) 	a. They'll think that my husband, and thus that I, *is/*am/*are crazy. 
	b. They'll think that your friends, and thus that you, are crazy.

Consider also:
(55)	a. I, or else possibly you, *am/*are in need of a rest. 
        	b. We, or else possibly you, are in need of a rest.

The point is that ungrammaticality results where there are conflicting requirements on verb forms that display agreement -- unless, as in the b-sentences, a phonological representation exists which can be inserted to satisfy both sets of constraints simultaneously. The facts are accounted for if derivations can be blocked by a failure to complete phonological interpretation, because of syntactic requirements that the lexicon cannot meet.

Chomsky (1967: 110) observes along similar lines that ``to study the questions...in a serious way, one has to investigate a real language system with dozens (if not hundreds) of phonological rules, with complex ordering conditions among them determined on empirical grounds;. . . it is of no use to study a subsystem with three or four rules.'' This task has been carried out in hundreds of books and theses written in the RBP framework, but remains to be carried out for any language in an OT framework.

fn. 6:

Michael Hammond's 1999 The Phonology of English: A Prosodic Optimality-Theoretic Approach, for example, covers only a tiny fragment of the phonological component of English. A search of amazon.com in May 2007 revealed only a single peer-reviewed, book-length OT treatment of the phonological component of a single language's grammar, Wheeler's 2005 treatment of Catalan.

One of the most robust cross-linguistic generalizations is that some derivations produce no output whatsoever \ldots Phenomena like this are easily analyzed in RBP, which has at its disposal inviolable output constraints with the power to crash a derivation.

who, using acoustic and electropalatalography, demonstrates this is not the case

``The vocalic portion in \emph{this} even with ``assimilated'' palatality is not theat of a syllable where the palatality is the exponent of a different (lexically relevant) systemic opposition''

p.~212:

The palatographic record of \emph{this \textbf{sh}op} shows that while there is tongue contact around the sides of the palate front-to-back throughout the period corresponding to the friction portion, the bulk of the tongue-palate contact is oriented towards the front of the palate. Compare this with the equivalent period taken from \emph{fi\textbf{sh sh}op}. The patterning of tongue-palate contacts here is very different. Predominantly, we find that the main part of the contact is oriented towards the back of the palate, with no contact occurring in the first three rows. This is in sharp contrast to the EPG record for \emph{this shop} where the bulk of the frames corresponding to the period fo friction show tongue-palate contact which includes the front three rows. Moreover, where \emph{this shop} exhibits back contact it is different in kind from that seen for \emph{fish shop} in terms of the overall area involved.[footnote omitted]. The difference here reflects the difference in phonological cstatus between the (``assimilatory'') palatality at the end of \emph{this}, an exponent of a particular kind of word juncture, and that of \emph{fish}, which is an exponent of lexically relevant palatality. },

realized in a given utterance can depend on many factors...as well as
individual speakers' characteristics which tend to affect their choice

A third step would attempt to relate one individual's pattern to those
of the other speakers.

p. 98: In its fear of losing possible categorical distinctions through
grouping data, this approach deliberately ignores the fact that
linguistic constraint effects tend to be shared, if not by an entire
community, then at least by a sizable group of speakers. In addition,
these procedures risk producing artificial categorical analyses which
will break down when more speakers and more data per speaker are added
to the data set, and they forgo the possibility of discovering
interesting quantitative generalizations.

The opposite approach would group data from different speakers
together for each type of context in order to improve the statistical
significance of the analysis.

Their disadvantages are that they necessarily assume a high degree of sharedness among speakers with respect to parameter values; they risk imposing irrelevant sociological distinctions on the linguistic data; and they are not specifically equipped for the discovery of categorical contexts where these do exist.},

p. 67: This latter property is very important if we wish to consider
each speaker as a separate feature in the analysis, rather than use an
a priori extralinguistic characterization (in terms of age, sex, sex,
etc.). Thus we can now analyze the Montreal French corpus, with 120
speakers, without grouping data from different speakers.

p. 68: A converse problem to the reduction of the dimensionality of
the model is adding dimensions: For example, if the description of the
whole population where all individuals have the same estimate for all
the factors is inadequate statistically, it is perhaps because some
subset of this population follows a different model. For example
suppose that one group in the population has a tendency to apply the
rule more frequently in the presence of feature X than when feature Y
is present, while another group applies it more for Y than for X in
corresponding contexts. This means perhaps the two parameters X and X'
and the two parameters Y and Y' should be included in the model, two
for the one group (_X,Y_), the other two for the second group
(_X',Y'_). A program is now operating which examines the population to
see whether it can be divided into two, three, etc. groups, each of
which is homogeneous, but among which there may be very different
values for one or more parameters or even different significant factor
groups. The log likelihood test in conjunction with simulation studies
shows whether the grouping obtained explains the data significantly
better than a single-group model.

The investigation of the prosodic and segmental properties of derivatives in -ize and -ify has shown that we are dealing with a case of phonologically conditioned suppletion. The two suffixes are (almost) complementarily distributed, with trochaic and dactylic bases taking -ize (e.g. r{á}ndom - r{á}ndom{\`\i}ze, f{é}deral - f{é}deral{\`\i}ze, but tube - *tubize), and iambic and monosyllabic bases taking -ify (tube - tubify, random - *r{á}ndomify). Stress shift is not possible (cf. *rand{\'o}mify). The only, but systematic, exception to the complementarity of -ize/-ify can be observed with trochaic base words ending in /I/, which take -ify under loss of that segment (as in nazify), or take -ize (with no accompanying segmental changes apart from optional glide insertion, as in toddyize).},

Since to approach inflectional morphology at all, one must have an overview of work in syntax, I suspect there has been an unstated belief in the minds of many linguists that inflectional morphology was not a field at all and would turn out to be entirely derivative of syntax. Furthermore, inflectional morphology is not as spectacular a field as syntax. Syntax treats such flashy processes as as relative clause formation and the dramatic movement of pieces of a sentence from one position to another. Case marking and number agreement seem tame by comparison.

If inflectional morphology seemed so prosaic as to be devoid of interest,...

Finally, we must not neglect the possibility of relevant psychological evidence [for a mapping between morphs and meaning--KG]. Of course we are a bit late to get it for Latin, and the language that we \emph{are} likely to get it for (namely English) is unfortunately of a different type; in psycholinguistics, as in linguistics, we must avod assuming that a single theory applies universally. [footnote omitted] However, there are various extant languages whose character is sufficiently similar; Italian, for example, exhibits a neat instance of ambiguous formatives in Noun and Modern Greek a great deal of affixal interdependence in the Verb. May one not hope, first, that the perception of morphological untis (the transition, in other words, from teh phonetic to the grammatical articulation of language) will begin to receive some attention in the psycholinguistic field, [footnote omitted] and secondly, in view of the blatant differences between languages, that the investigation will proceed on a somewhat wider basis than practitioners of this subject have sometimes thought necessary? Certain tests---tests, for example, which might yield positive evidence against the concept of morphemic signalling-units---seem to an outsider at least to be relatively straightforward. It would be helfpul to know if the results are, indeed, as the linguistic evidence might lead one to predict.

The term (German `Morphonem', to be exact) was first introduced by Trubetzkoy for precisely the `knife/knives' type of case; see Trubetzkoy, 1934:29f.

Of the class of nasal phonemes, one would say, only the member \emph{m} can appear before \emph{p}, only the member \emph{n} before \emph{t}, and so on. This was also the approach adopted in our original illustration of generative phonotactics, rule (19): the phonological grammar stated that the voiceless plosives \emph{k}, etc.~can appear before \emph{s}, but that the voiced plosives \emph{g}, etc.~(this is indicated \emph{ex silentio}) cannot.[footnote omitted] But this is to assume that once we have left the `phonology' of the transformationalists [omitted] all we can return to is the `phonemics' of the post-Bloomfieldians. To the American school this was indeed a problem of gaps in the distribution of elements. But most European phonologists took a different view: instead of saying that in a certain position element \emph{a} appeared but element \emph{b} did not, one might talk instead of the suspension of opposition between two elements in the system.

Although the features that serve to identify extensions are considered subtractively between simplex and extended radicals, a description of the part played by extensions in a language must take into account the fact that many of them also occur with complex radicals. 

In general terms, extensions occur with complex in much the same way as they do with simplex radicals, a fact which has been implicit in some of the examples quoted in the footnotes to the list of extensions. },

stuff about back-formation verbs

408:

/st/ is an old IE symbol that has formed many words with the basic idea `stand' and `step' which are common Indo-European property (OGr[eek] root \emph{sta-}, L[atin] root \emph{sta-}, etc., in English represented by such words as \emph{stand}, \emph{step}, \emph{stead}, \emph{sty}, etc.). Apart form this common stock, English has only a few new formations, as \emph{stumble} 1325 (see \emph{-umble} 7.81.), \emph{stamp} 12000 with variant \emph{stomp} (the word is not recorded in OE, but the ablaut form \emph{stempan} `stamp' is). Both words are obviously mere sound imitations with the symbol /st/, and as the initial symbol is common in Indo-European languages, it is no wonder that parellel words should be found in so many languages; see the entry \emph{stamp} in the OED. The OED establishes asterisked Germanic forms for the wrod. Newer are \emph{stodge} `stuff, gorge' 1674 (for the symbolic value of \emph{-odge} see \emph{-udge}), \emph{stash} (\emph{st-} plus \emph{-ash}), AE (H.~Melville). OED has anothe \emph{stash} `stop abruptly' 1811 which is a blend of \emph{st(ay, stop)} plus \emph{-ash}. 

/str/ forms several groups with the initial: the `stride' group is represented by \emph{straddle} 1565 - dial.~\emph{stroddle} 1607, perhaps ablaut variants of \emph{striddle} `straddle', etc. 1530 (the latter is either a frequentative form of \emph{stride} or back-derived from \emph{striddling}), \emph{stroll} 1603 (the second element is that of \emph{roll}, \emph{loll}, etc.). 
	\emph{Struggle} 1386 is probably a blend suggeste by \emph{strive} and obs.~\emph{tuggle} `tug'. \emph{Strum} 1775 was suggested by \emph{strike}, while the final is that of \emph{drum}, \emph{thrum}

Blevins (2004:237) proposes a methodological principle: ``Principled diachronic explanations for sound patterns have priority over competing synchronic ones unless independent evidence demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt, that a synchronic account is warranted.'' We take this proposal to mean that if a grammar is unattested and there is a diachronic explanation for its lack of attestation, then there are no phonological mechanisms that prevent the grammar from being generated.

We question the premise of this methodological principle. If a sound pattern has a diachronic explanation, it does not necessarily follow that there must be no synchronic account. Since diachronic change is influenced by performance pressures, the principle amounts to saying that the existence of a phonological constraint cannot be influenced by performance pressures (or at least those that influence diachronic change).},

The type of preemption in which the grammaticality of one form implies the ungrammaticality of another can be called categorical preemption. Categorical preemption stands in contrast to statistical preemption, which Goldberg (2006:93) defines in terms of ``repeated witnessing'' of competing forms. In categorical preemption, unlike statistical preemption, witnessing the preempting form only once could, in principle, be sufficient to learn that the preempted form is ungrammatical as an expression of the relevant meaning. For example, a learner with an excellent memory who is very astute could learn that *goed is ungrammatical as the past tense of go, simply by hearing went once, as long as the learner knows that the two have (or would have) the same meaning. Statistical preemption, by contrast, is a potential mechanism for acquiring contrasts in grammaticality between forms that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. 
11: ``there is no conventional near-synonymous alternative form that outcompetes the ungrammatical form in question for the same slot, and yet, the form is ungrammatical.'' (point that calling them "exceptions" begs the question)
12: I will argue that there are two orthogonal dichotomies, one between arbitrariness and criteria-governed productivity, and one between conservatism and negative evidence
13: If they do overgeneralize at first, they need negative evidence in order to change their grammar, regardless of whether the grammars they end up with contain arbitrary exceptions. Although the choice between these theoretical options is open in principle, there is strong evidence for the presence of an overgeneralization, hence, for the role of negative evidence.

The most important thing Whitney taught was the following. If we ascribe to language an independent existence, certain activities, certain inclinations or moods, a capability for adapation to the requirements of mankind, and other similar things -- then these are only figurative expressions. They do not signify the thing itself, and one should not permit oneself to be deluded by then. In reality, language lives only in the minds and on the lips of those who speak it.

Described in this way, the generalization that paradigm gaps occur only where automatic rules have failed to apply is made explicit, while, at the same time, the need for a component of dubious \emph{ad hoc} filters in phonology is removed.

[this is ridiculous! but all the rules are surface true. and lack of root allomorphy...]

141:

one characteristic common to all cases [of defectiveness] is that paradigms with gaps show no allomorphy of the root morpheme, but would if the gap were filled. 

paradigm gaps occcur only where automatic rules [exceptionless, surface-true generalizations--KG] have failed to apply

142:

two other possible gaps: lat 'lazy' (*latt) and flat 'flat' (*flatt). quotes hellberg (1972: 14) that

That approach advocated in this paper incorrectly predicts that \emph{lat} and \emph{flat}, if they are to be irregular at all, should not produce gaps in the neuter but rather should pattern like \emph{absolut}, with the same form serving both neuter and non-neuter functions. Their neuter absence, along with that, for some speakers, of the more obscure form \emph{skraj} `scared' (*\emph{skrajt}) remains mysterious. },

Subject clitics: 
1. T governs Agr. T appears to the right of an inflected verb
2. Agr is specified for case and number. Only those subjects specified for number, which are projections of NumP may agree w/ Agr
3. 1st and 2nd person pronouns are elements of D, but do not have a specification for grammatical number. Consequently, the 1st and 2nd person pronouns may not be coindexed w/ Agr or receive case.
4. The subject clitics which mark inherent case are daughters to the left of Agr. These clitics are specified for case and person.
5. Since Georgian permits null subjects in all persons, PRO in the subject position should be allowed. The 1st and 2nd person pronouns are identified as part of a clitic chain. A special plural marker -t is attached to these forms which provides the [+aug] feature to the verbal complex. this marker is used to mark the plurality of subjects which do not receive case through AGR.

1. Objects receive their case from AGR and not from lexical verbs
2. Pronominal objects of the 1st and 2nd person may not receive case from Agr as they are underspecified for number. They are doubled[?] clitics adjoined to the left of the verb.
3. In Georgian, the combination of clitics is impossible since the incorporation of two clitics to a verb prevents one from having its' trace governed.
4. Only the object clitic is attached to a verb. When such a conflict arises, the subject of 1st and 2nd person is identified by the negative value of Agr. [huh?]
5. The marker of plural, /-t/, is attached to a verb to which it provides the necessary features for identification of the arguments of the 1st and 2nd person by a clitic chain. },

[nice discussion of priority in allomorphy re: wolf and mccarthy]

61 [fn. 17]:

It is possible that Wolf and McCarthy's characterization of this sequential ordering of tasks is only metaphorical and that the `priority relationship' could be encoded in a way that does not require sequential ordering; Wolf and McCarthy do not spell out the specific mechanism by which the priority relationship is manifested.

70:

[on kager] P >> M can't free us of ``elsewhere'', but now it's a stipulation

106 [fn. 37]:

The notion of the `elsewhere' case may be implemented in any number of different ways; for example, in an OT model of morphology, some morphological constraint requiring 2sg to be marked by -s could be outranked by another morphological constraint requiring 2sg to be marked by -El, which could in turn be outranked by an undominated (and perhaps inviolable) constraint prohibiting subcategorization frames from being disobeyed. Under such a ranking, a hypothetical stem that satisfies both the phonological subcategorization requirements for the more specific -El allomorph and the (nonexistent) requirements for the -s allomorph can have two 2sg candidates that satisfy the highest ranked constraint against violation of subcategorization frames, but the candidate satisfying the highly ranked 2sg=-El constraint will win out over the candidate satisfying 2sg=-s, and therefore the allomorph with the more specific environment will always be used when that environment is met. In a different hypothetical case where the stem does not meet the requirements for affixation of the more specific allomorph, the inviolable constraint against violating subcategorization frames will filter out candidates that incorrectly use the more specific allomorph.

This breakdown confirms the earlier suspicion that the -e-/-i- group is essentially an amalgam of (a) verbs with an \v{E} or \v{I} [sic] or, to use a later cut-off point, an /e/ in the critical segment of the stem-verbs among which, for semantic reasons, the -\~{n}ir molecule is likely to have played the decisive role; and (b) verbs with an \v{E} > ie in the stem so placed as to adjoin a consonant palatal or palatally tinged, hence subject to monophthongization by virtue of the same trend that reduced \emph{-iello} to \emph{-ill}o (ex-ir, segu-ir, serv-ir, vest-ir).

p.~471:

(1) The paradox of the -e-/-i- verbs (like cen-ir/cin-o) is that the range of i in
the singular indicative (1, 2, 3, 6) would better fit a rising diphthong (ie or ue) than a monophthong reputedly arrived at through metaphony. Such diphthongs depend on stress; metaphony emphatically does not.
(2) The difficulty is smoothed out if we posit two initially unrelated major sources for -i-: (a) genuine metaphony, operative chiefly in ! E stems (concebir, constreiir, fenir, medir, etc.), and (b) the monophthongization of the diphthong -ie- stimulated by the contiguity of s-, -s (+ cons.), -x and the vicinity of r-, cons. + r, cons. + 1, etc. (say, exir, seguir, servir, vestir beside embestir).

Indeed, it seems thoroughly mystical to maintain that every aspect of language has an explanatory basis in some other domain, given our rather limited success in actually finding secure explanations of this sort for any aspect of Language.

503: [Jakobson's later work has the view that distinctive features' role is to characterize ``phonologically unitary classes'']

504: However, the premise that phonological classes are generally phonetically natural ones does not really serve to establish the conclusion that phonological features can be identified with articulatory, acoustic, or some other sort of parameters. That is, the central phonological function of a set of features is to allow the classification of sound elements along a number of dimensions, so as to reveal their similarities in behavior with respect to the sound pattern of the language.

509: An adequate account of the nature of phonological structure \ldots must provide some basis for the apparent connetion between phonetic and phonological effects, but must also recognize the essential independence of the later domain from rigid deterministic control by the former.

\ldots even where a phonological process in a given languag ecan be related in some way to an explanation from outside of language proper,the language-particular rule cannot be \emph{identified} with the extralinguistic phenomenon.

513: Phonologization is most noticeable in the form of conditioned exaggeration of a mechanical effect, but we can recognize the same principle when a general effect is suppressed: in Saudi Arabic, for example, when mechanical vowel lengthening is apparently prevented under linguistic control (possibly related to the fact that length is contrastive in Arabic, although Lehiste (1970) shows that mechanical lengthening may occur in the presence of a length contrast) \ldots

514: When a rule is phonologized, however, it is important to recognize that its status has changed: even though it may have originated in the exigencies of articulatory dynamics, for example, when it is incorporated under the control of the cognitive system which is at the heart of Language, these factors no longer limit or prescribe its content. 

Phonetic explanation thus serves as a sort of constrainton the entry of processes into the system, since (at least many, if not perhapsall) rules originate in the raw material of phonetically natural variation.},

(acceptable paraphrase: "lls sont en train de frire")

Defective words propose a problem for most theories of morphology, because so many of them rely on an "elsewhere" or "default" case to account for the more productive morphological strategies. If there were always a default, then speakers would always have a way of generating the various forms of a noun or verb. 

131:

{\ldots}in a given language, the gaps occur in a restricted set of inflections and for a conjugational class often associated with some morphophonological properties. The diacritic approach misses those generalizations entirely. 

The second argument is the most serious one and can be restated in terms of negative evidence. Given that we know that speakers are able to produce or inflect words that they have never heard before, teh default cannot be [$-$\textsc{Lexical Insertion}]. If that were the default setting, then this would amount fo saying that every word is learned, a conclusion that woudl go against any generative model of morphology? 

132: {\ldots}speakers are typically puzzled and unsure, and claim to not know the correct form. They are genuinely unsatisfied with the ones they come up with or the ones that are proposed to them.

136: [google hits for stridden]

141: TWCW then predicts that only speakers who have learned both the forms \emph{stride} and \emph{strode} may have a gap in the past participle (unless they have also learned the inherited form \emph{stridden}). Speakers who hae a simple past tense form \emph{strided} are predicted not to have a past participle gap.

This procedure was appropriately criticized by \citet{Bickerton1973a,Bickerton1973b} and others, since it makes it difficult to tell whether the observed variation is in fact present in the speceh of individuals, rather than being simply the artifact of lumping together disparate, but internally homogeneous, individuals.

27: All 4 of the New Yorkers have Q greater than V; this is true of only 1 of the 19 Philadelphians. Two New Yorkers have Q greater even than K, whereas not one Philadelphian does. This is a clear example of a genuine dialect differences~\ldots~For the New Yorkers, a following pause is like a following consonant in its effect on final /t, d/ deletion: [i]t promotes it~\ldots~For the Philadelphians, however, Q is an extremely conservative environment, even more so than a following vowel.

                       & following consonant & following vowel & following pause \\ 
3 white New Yorkers    & 1.0                 & 0.56            & 0.83 \\
9 white Philadelphians & 1.0                 & 0.38            & 0.12 \\

Kiparksy's suggestion that observed patterns of variation might be accounted for by universal functional conditions is clearly untenable for a case such [this] \ldots the effect of pause is arbitrarily defined for a given dialect---it must be learned by children acquiring a dialect, and must be accounted for in the grammar of a dialect.

30: The high degree of correspondence between the group values and the individual values of Joanne H. is further evidence that speakers have essentially identical norms for final /t, d/ deletion, and that one only needs to obtain large amounts of data to demonstrate this fact. We feel that for most of the constraints on this rule (and other cases of ``Type 1'' variation) differences between individuals are primarily random perturbations due to paucity of data rather than real behavioral differences.

Bickerton and others have objected to the practice of using group data in studying variation. These writers assert that much of the ``apparent variation'' found in several variable rule analyses by other researchers using group data is the result of an inappropriate lumping together of different speakers and different conditioning environments.

4: [competence and performance]
5: The limitations of traditional and structuralist grammars should be clearly appreciated. Although such grammars may contain full and explicit lists of exceptions and irregularities, they only provide examples and hints concerning the regular and productive syntactic processes.
8: Obviously, every speaker of a language has mastered and internalized a generative grammar tha expresses his knowledge of his language. This is not to say that he is aware of the rules of the grammar or even that he can become aware of them, or that his statements about his intuitive knowledge of the language are necessarily accurate. Any interesting generative grammar will be dealing for the most part, with mental processes that are far beyond the level of actual or even potential consciousness; furthermore, it is quite apparent that a speaker's reports and viewpoints about his behavior and his competence may be in error.
9: we say nothing about how the speaker or hearer might proceed, in some practical or efficient way, to construct such a derivation
11: The more acceptable sentences are those that are more likely to be produced, more easily understood, less clumsy, and in some sense more natural.[fn] The unacceptable sentences one would tend to avoid and replace by more acceptable variants, wherever possible, in natural discourse.

The notion ``acceptable'' is not to be confused with ``grammatical.'' Acceptability is a concept that belongs to the study of performance, whereas grammaticalness belongs to the study of competence. 

Grammaticalness is only one of the many factors that interact to determine acceptability. 

15: The facts, however, seem to be that the only studies of performance, outside of phonetics (but see note 3), are those carried out as a by-product of work in generative grammar.

19: There are, in other words, very few reliable experimental or data-processing procedures for obtaining significant information concerning the linguistic intuition of the native speaker. It is important to  bear in mind that when an operational procedure is proposed, it must be tested for adequacy (exactly as a theory of linguistic intuition --- a grammar --- must be tested for adequacy) by measuring it against the standard provided by the tacit knowledge that it attempts to specify and describe.
24: [descriptive adequacy]
25: [primary linguistic data]

To the extent that a linguistic theory succeeds in selecting a descriptively adequate grammar on the basis of primary linguistic data, we can say that it meets the condition of \emph{explanatory adequacy}.

26: As in any other field, the important problem in linguistics is to discover a complex of data that differentiates between conflicting conceptions of linguistic structure in that one of these conflicting theories can describe these data only by \emph{ad hoc} means whereas the other can explain it on the basis of some empirical assumption about the form of language.
27: [internal vs. external]
28: [substantive universal]
29: [formal universal]
30: A child who is capable of learning language must have 

(12) (i) a technique for representing input signals
     (ii) a wawy of representing structural information about these signals
     (iii) some initial delimitation of a class of possible hypotheses about language structure
     (iv) a method for determining what each such hypothesis implies with respect to each sentence
     (v) a method for selecting one of the (presumably, infinitely many) hypotheses that are allowed by (iii) and are compatible with the given primary linguistic data

32 (quoted in baker 1979:564, fn. 32): a partial and tentative pairing of signals with structural descriptions

To say that say that the assumption about innate linguistic capacity is extremely strong is, of course, not to say that it is incorrect.

37: Rather, a proposal concerning such a measure [an evaluation procedure--KG] is an empirical hypothesis about the nature of language

42: Thus, choice of an evaluation measure constitutes a decision as to what are ``similar processes'' or ``natural classes''---in short, what are significnat generalizations.

58: [intence of grammar and intelligence]

59: However, there is surely no reason today for taking seriously a position that attributes a complex human achievement entirely to months (or at most years) of experience, rather than to millions of years of evolution or to principles of neural organization that may be even more deeply grounded in physical law---a position that would, furthermore, yield the conclusion that man is, apparently unique among animals in the way in which he acquires knowledge.

On the basis of the best information now available, it seems reasonable to suppose that a child cannot help constructing a particular sort of transformational grammar to account for the data presented to him, any more thanb he can control his perception of solid objects or his attention to line and angle.

60: [weak and strong generative capacity]

193: [beautiful endnote on mentalism]

195: These characterizations are equally vague and the concepts involved are equally obscure. The notion ``likely to be produced'' or ``probable'' is sometimes thought to be more ``objective'' and antecedently better define than teh others, on the assumption that there is some clear meaning to the notion ``probability of a sentence'' or ``probability of a sentence type.'' Actually, the latter notions are obgjective and antecedently clear only if probabiltiy is bsaed on an estimate of relative frequency and if sentence type means something like ``sequence of word or morpheme class.'' \ldots~But in this case, though ``probability of a sentence (type)'' is clear and well defined, it is an utterly useless notion, since almost all highly acceptable sentences (in the intuitive sense) have probabilities empirically indistiguishable from zero and will belong to sentence types with probabilities empirically indistinguishable from zeroThus the acceptable or grammatical sentences (or sentence types) are no more likely, in any objective sence of this word, than the others. 

200f. [en. 14]:

It seems clear that many children acquire first or second languages quite successfully even though no special care is taken to teach them and no special attention is given to their progress. It also seems apparent that much of the actual sepech observed consists of fragments and deviant expressions of a variety of sorts. Thus it seems a child must have the ability to ``invent'' a generative grammar that definies well-formedness and assigns interpretations to sentences even though the primary linguistic data that he uses as a basis for this act of theory construction may, from the point of view of the theory he constructs, be deficient in various respects.

while virtually all studies \ldots assume that the results of Wug tests reflect a speaker's current representation of the inflectional system of their language, I argue that this assumption must be questioned. When we ask speakers to imagine the existence of a nonce verb such as \emph{spling}, we could be asking them two fundamentally different kinds of questions.

One invokes what I call the dictionary scenario: We are saying to the speaker, ``I bet you didn't know this, but if you look in a big dictionary you'll find that English has an obscure verb \emph{spling}; now, tell me what you think its past tense is'' The second invokes what I call the neologism scenario: We are saying to the speaker, ``I've just decided to make up a new verb spling to describe this really cool way of bouncing a paper clip that I discovered. Now, how do you think I should say it in the past tense?'' (This is pretty much the scenario explicitly created for children in acquisition experiments.) 

Under the dictionary scenario, it would be reasonable for a speaker to make a judgement about the shape of the extant lexicon of English, reasoning as follows: For speakers of, say, 50 years ago who had spling in their vocabulary along with (almost) all the current words of English that the participant already knows, how would those speakers most likely have inflected it? This is presumably what a dictionary would indicate. Analogy would likely play a large role in arriving at an answer.

Under the neologism scenario, by contrast, there are two other ways that speakers could proceed. The first would be to assume that they are in a genuine everyday neologism situation -- the nonce word has indeed been coined, perhaps by the advertiser of a new product -- and invoke their knowledge of how neologisms are inflected in the language \ldots In other words, they follow any special procedures the grammar may have for ne- ologisms.

464:

In English (at least), irregular past tenses are rarely volunteered in the traditional elicitation version of the Wug test (e.g., given \emph{spling} speakers most often produce \emph{splinged}). However, if asked to judge the goodness of \emph{splung} as a past tense of \emph{spling}, they may rate it about as highly as splinged. The clearest data on this point are found in Albright and Hayes 2003.

465:

There were 17 nonce verbs (out of a total of 58) whose (potential) irregular past tense was never produced but was nonetheless rated at least as high as the overall mean for irregulars; these included \emph{drice}~\emph{droce}, \emph{flidge}~\emph{fludge}, \emph{chake}~\emph{chook}, \emph{kive}~\emph{kave}. Three irregulars that were never produced (fleep~flept, nold~neld, chind~chound) were rated higher than their regular alternatives. One interpretation of this striking dissociation could be conceived in terms of production versus comprehension: ``My grammar generates splinged, but I would not be surprised if someone else's generated splung.'' speakers might subconsciously say to themselves, or, ``I would have no trouble interpreting splung as the past of spling, if I knew there was a verb spling to begin with.'' This would result from treating the rating task as a dictionary scenario but the elicitation task as a neologism acquisition scenario.

The dictionary scenario, I will argue, involves a frequency-weighted estimate of similarity to the existing vocabulary using a family resemblance structure.

465f:

I maintain that the dictionary scenario is in key aspects the analogue in language of the following task from cognitive psychology. I describe to you a supposed newly-discovered species of bird found on a previously unexplored island: this bird has a large belly and a long neck, and stands three feet high. Now I ask you to guess whether or not this bird can fly (cf. Nisbett et al. 1983). Evidently people respond in this task by applying some metric of similarity (to bird species they know about) along dimensions that they believe to be relevant to the flight behaviour of birds. Continuing the analogy, there is presumably some genuine lawful relationship between various as- pects of a bird's physiology and whether or not it can fly, but the potential success of nonexperts in the flight-judgement task would not lead us to conclude that they know those physiological principles; rather, they know some superficial (partial) correlates of them. I.e., it so happens that most bird species extant today that are three feet tall or more cannot fly, but there is no physiological causal connection between this externally observable trait and flight potential; the correlation is an accident of history. (Teratorns could stand over four feet tall but could still fly.) Nonetheless, a domain-general pattern-learning algorithm can do no more or less than extract the (probabilistic) generalizations from its input. The input that feeds the dic- tionary scenario is speakers' cumulative experience with their language, i.e. occurrences of particular verbs in particular forms with particular meanings.

en. 13:

I am crucially assuming that learners might establish a lexical entry specifying that a verb takes an irregular inflection without hearing direct positive evidence for this. Whether this is plausible for Modern English might be questioned. The fact that formerly regular verbs have on occasion innovated an irregular past tense (e.g., \emph{ring}, \emph{dig}, \emph{dive}) might support this contention, though it is hard to rule out the possibility that adults made the innovation, perhaps consciously, e.g. in an attempt to sound more educated.},

17: some combination of morphemes in the input is ruled absolutely ungrammatical for apparently phonological reasons, leaving a hole in the paradigm that is filled by periphrasis, suppletion, or allomorphy.

[shitty definition]

\emph{harmony threshold}: {\sc MParse} is able to set a standard that any viable candidate has to satisfy, so constraints ranked higher than {\sc MParse} are defacto inviolable.

18: some languages have phonological processes that are exceptionless in attested surface forms, and crucially any forms that appropriately condition these processes but fail to undergo them lack any surface realization (rather than simply being exceptions to the process and surfacing without having undergone it). Put somewhat differently, these are cases where some phonologically ill-formed configuration $\Gamma$ is always eliminated on the surface, and where the phonological process that normally eliminates $\Gamma$ is disallowed for some defined class of words, forcing the grammar to outright gaps in order to maintain the surface absence of $\Gamma$. 

19f: For example, the adjective \emph{callous} does not take the suffix \emph{-ity} in English, and our understanding of this fact is not significantly advanced by analysis in terms similar to the account of Norwegian imperatives. 

Formal gaps are also unnecessary in describing restrictions on phonotactics, segmental inventories, and the like. Phonotactic ill-formedness is more typically attributed to neutralizing mappings in which the prohibited structures merge with some other structure that is surface-licit. For instance, it is not necessary that /bn\textsci k/ map to the null output in English; absent alternations, the non-existence of [bn\textsci k] can as well be accounted for by mapping /bn\textsci k/ to, say, [n\texsci k]. Nonetheless, various researchers have used the null output in analyses of derivational gaps (Raffelsiefen 2004) and phonotactic gaps (Prince and Smolensky 2004: 57). 

20: Still, the point remains that it is inflectional gaps that most clearly show the \emph{need} for the null output as candidate. [WHY IS THIS?]

[difference between a fully-deleted candidate and the null output]

20: Finally, it should be noted that our argument here goes well beyond the familiar difficulty that OT systems have with ineffability. One could integrate some attempt to deal with that problem into Bresnan's system---e.g. the Null Parse, as discussed recently in McCarthy and Wolf (2005)---and still have the result that the primary prediction of the clausal competition approach is not verified. All that the Null Parse (or equivalent) would do is reduce the number of possible instances in which effects of the strong prediction of Bresnan's approach---POPPING OUT---could be detected.

21f: [redefine correspondence to differentiate these two]

33: [problems with the interp of MParse]
Attributing the violation that the null output (.) incurs to a failure of \emph{morphological} parsing presents other problems, however. First, it is difficult to maintain that all cases of phonologically-conditioned gaps involve a failure in the lexical, word-level phonology, as a morphological interpretation of the null prase would seem to require. The main evidence that gaps are not purely a matter of morphology comes from the observation that the Norwegian imperative gap depends on the phrasal phonological context (section 4.2). 

38: Norwegian must not have a \emph{lexical} gap for the imperative of verbs like /\o{a}pn/, because these imperatives actually occur when the final sonorant can be syllabified as an onset before a following vowel-initial word (Rice 2005a): [example]

This contrast shows that the gap -- that is, the victory of the candidate (.) -- cannot be determined until the phrase-level phonology. We conclude that an analysis with morphologically restricted {\sc MParse} is untenable. [will this solve other problems though?]

[questions about whether phonology can make syntax ungrammatical]
[ties this to P>>M model w/ dyirbal PCSA]

40: [other degenerate candidates are harmonically bounded by (.)] This is because any candidate with output structure will incur at least one markedness violation, whereas (.) incurs none. 

section 4: consequences for other types of FAITH

51f: Gaps present an obvious challenge to the language learner. If grammars are learned only from positive evidence, then learners cannot discover the existence of gaps or the constraint rankings that produce them. This means that learners must assume gaps until proven otherwise --- they must go from a grammar that allows only gaps to a grammar that disallows some gaps. This is in accordance with the Subset Principle, which requires learning to proceed from the maximally restrictive grammar to successively less restrictlve ones [cite]. 

(presuming gaps until positive evidence...)

52: This means that unfaithfulness is allowed in a particular paradigmatic slot only when required by alternations observable in the primary data. When a particular morphosyntactic feature combination MS exhibits epenthesis, the \textsc{dep}$_MS$ constraint proper to MS will be demoted below \textsc{MParse}. Absent such alternations, forms in the MS category would map to \np~if the alternative is a violation of [an M constraint--KG]. 

53: What is important is that leaners need not discover gaps because they presume gaps everywhere until they encounter evidence to the contrary. 

This situation stands in stark contrast to the problem of learning gaps in a theory based on inviolable constraints, Orgun and Sprouse's (1999, this volume) {\sc Control} model. 

[learning problem...too much in {\sc Control}...some things need to be in {\sc Eval}]

54: This approach could perhaps be made to work when there is a consistent substitute for the gap, such as English \emph{more violet} for *\emph{violeter}. [note the metalinguistic comparision:  `That flower is more violet than lavendar'', but also attested, and very grammatical, ``\ldots I think that cloud seeding is more smart than scary'' compared to "smarter than scary"] But it is difficult to imagine a learning mechanism powerful enough to identify diverse expressions in Norwegian as paraphrases of or circumlocutions for `open!' or `bicycle!', and then to connect this with the absence of `open!' and `bicycle!' from the primary data. It would seem to be necessary for learners to scrutinize every phrase and ask whether it could be paraphrased with a single word using the language's morphological resources, and then to check whether that word has been previously heard. 

55f: [max(category) can't do zero-morph gaps, or ones with longer structure]

[assumes past parts derived from preterites]
[look at past participles with /ow/ pasts: sold, (fore-)told]

That means that for verbs with irregular past tense forms in [o\textupsilon], speakers do not have any usable generalization that lets them confidently predict the past participle. In most cases, this is not a problem, since the verbs in (2) are generally common enough that speakers can memorize their participles, and need not use their grammar to derive the output. 

[list: shone, worn, torn, sworn, born(e), broken, woken, spoken, stolen, frozen, woven, chosen, written, driven, risen, ridden]

In order to formalize this intuition, we need two components. First, it is crucial for this analysis that forms in the paradigm are projected from particular other forms --- e.g., that past participles in English are generated with reference to the simple past forms, and cannot be projected directly from present tense forms.

gaps are AGGRESSIVE. This property is puzzling, since the gaps themselves provide no positive evidence to ``defend themselves'' against the occasional data provided by speakers who are willing to utter [syk devoiced l] or [abole] --- and, more generally, there is no overt evidence showing that such forms cannot be used. Given that there do exist small amounts of evidence \emph{against} gaps, the challenge is to explain why these solutions do not take over. One possibility is that the level of attestation for the fixes is simply too low to be learned. [how many attestations are needed! is it a lot or a little?] An alternative possibility that I will pursue here, however, is that there is a more active force involved: gaps follow from a deeper issue, which sporadic pieces of data are not able to alleviate.

129:

[he's right about conservative learning of MParse, speakers have productivity]
fails to capture the intuition that lexically arbitrary gaps affect potentially irregular forms of words that belong to small and highly irregular inflectional classes

130:

gaps affect those morphological classes where the incidence of irregularity is highest, affecting not just some, but \emph{nearly all} relevant lexical items. We see that gaps are strongest in cases where irregularity nears 100\%. [what does this mean?] This is unexpected if gaps stem from inability to resolve competition between two evenly matched patterns, since competition would be fiercest in a class that is 50\% regular and 50\% irregular.

Hansson's intuition is that speakers know the verbs with this shape are typically irregular, but they are unable or unwilling to assume the ``expected irregular'' \emph{-t\textsuperscript{h}}. Thus, they are left with an irresolvable clash between the grammatically expected regular form, and the analogically expected irregular form.

It is natural to wonder why generalizations should be so fragmented in this case, when in other cases, it can be shown that speakers do form generalizations that cover different morphological contexts and multiple segments. [he suggests the differential statistics may cause learners to separate them all -- another possibility is that the rule is unified but the generalizations about it are not, and that the contexts for conditioning come for free...]

148:

What is puzzling is why there should ever be any doubt about whether the palatalization alternations in (17) should apply, since they always apply in this class. It is also mysterious why only the coronals are affected, since labials also alternate.

One might propose that all words formed by non- productive rules are marked by these rules as [$-$\textsc{Lexical Insertion}]. The smaller subset of actually occurring words formed by such rules would then be listed in the filter with the feature [$-$\textsc{Lexical Insertion}]. That is, the nouns formed with the suffix \emph{-al} would all be generated with the feature [$-$\textsc{Lexical Insertion}]; the relatively small number of actually occurring nouns of this type, like those listed in (3a), will appear in the filter marked [$+$\textsc{Lexical Insertion}]. In other words, it is assumed that words generated by a productive process are all actually occurring and that only exceptionally may a word of this type be ruled out of the language. On the other hand, words generated by a nonproductive rule are assumed not to be occurring except under special circumstances. In this fashion we might capture the difference between productive and nonproductive formations. },

Although not all of the hypothesized cross-language perceptual differences were found, both listener groups were particularly sensitive to native(-like) coarticulatory effects.

A systematic outcome was that, the more inappropriate the context (noncanonical as compared to canonical trials), the more listeners compensated (i.e., based their responses on coarticulatory appropriateness rather than acoustic identity) but only as long as the paired appropriate coarticulatory effects were familiar to the listeners.

Phonologically active class:

A group of sounds in an inventory which do at least one of the following, to the exclusion of all other sounds in the inventory:

- undergo a phonological process,
- trigger a phonological process, or
- exemplify a static distributional restriction.

14-15:

The concepts ``phonologically active class'', ``featurally natural class'', adn ``phonetically natural class'' have often been conflated in phonological theory as the monolithic ``natural class''.

21:

While it is clearly important to have a theory of possible and impossible or likely and unlikely phonological phenomena, there is no reason to believe that hte formalism for the cognitive representation of phonological patterns is the only appropriate place for such a theory.

23:

\ldots innateness is not a fairly standard assumption, and it is not clear what if any evidence brought about this shift.

29:

No observations about phonological patterns may be attributed to facts about features themselves (e.g. their innate organization in the brain), with no interpretation in phonetics, language change, or anywhere else.

40:

[discussion of Ladefoged and Disner]

63-68:

[nasal ambivalence, actually preference for +cont]

85:

The results of these changes [e.g., final devoicing] could be described using features such as [voice] or [sonorant], but again, the features themselves do not solely account for the sound change. The sound change allows for the descriptive use of the features.

98:

Similarly, it is sometimes the case that two innate features are equally able to define a natural class. For example, in languages with no voiced obstruents, [+sonorant] and [+voice] define the same group of sounds, and the linguist must choose which feature to use. In emergent feature theory, the feature that defines such a class is abstract and does not need to be related to the features which have been used to account for phenomena in other languages.

[In emergent feature theory], the features themselves are, if anything, more abstract than the phonetically defined innated features are argued to be. In emergent feature theory, phonologically active classes (which form the basis for features) are learned as the result of observations about the phonological patterns which exist in the adult language, and as a result of generalizations about the properties of speech sounds.

99: However, since the phonetic similarity is secondary to the fact that the grouping is phonologically significant, the class could just as easily be thought of as ``the segments that do X'' and the abstract property that connects them could just as easily be called "z". This is the conclusion reached by \citet{Anderson1981} and others.

Phonological features and phonologically active classees are potentially isomorphic. No feature needs to be learned that is not motivated by the presence of a phonologically active class.},

43-44:

At the same time it is evident, on the basis of our considerations, that this appearance of success \emph{cannot in the least be regarded as a sign of truth and correspondence with nature}. Quite the contrary, the suspicion arises that the absence of major difficulties is a result of the decrease of empirical content brought about by the elimination of alternatives, and of facts that can be discovered with their help. In other words, \emph{the suspicion arises that this alleged success is due to the fact that the theory, when extended beyond its starting point, was turned into rigid ideology.} Such ideology is `successful' not because it agrees so well with the facts; it is successful because no facts have been specified that could constitute a test, and because some such facts have even been removed. Its `success' \emph{is entirely man-made}. It was decided to stick to some ideas, come what may, and teh result was, quite naturally, the survival of these ideas. 

45:

Observational results, too, will speak in favour of the theory, as they are formulated in its terms. It will seem that the truth has at last been arrived at. At the same time, it is evident that all contact with the world has been lost and that the stability achieved, the semblance of absolute truth, \emph{is nothing but the result of an absolute conformism}. 

65:

Accroding to Hume, theories cannot be \emph{derived from} facts. The demand to admit only those theories which follow from facts leaves us without any theory. 

65-66:

According to our present results, hardly any theory is \emph{consistent with} the facts. The demand to admit only those thoeries which are consistent with the available and accepted facts again leaves us without any theory. Hence, a science as we know it can exist only if we drop this demand also and again revise our methodology, \emph{now admitting counterinduction in addition to admitting unsupported hypotheses}. 

67:

Consideration of all these circumstances, of observation terms, sensory core, auxiliary sciences, background speculation, suggest that a theory may be inconsistent with the evidence, not because it is incorrect, \emph{but because the evidence is contaminated}. 

173:

The `fact' of irregularity, ofr example is not accessible without further ado. It cannot be discovered by just anyone who has healthy eyes and a good mind. It is only through a certain expectation that it becomes an object of our attention. Or, to be more accurate, this fact of irregularity \emph{exists} because there is an expectation of regularity. AFter all, the term `irregularity' makes sense only if we have a rule.

In that case, innovators have the more passive role of simply favoring the more commonly noted deviations from the norm, without reflecting on their phonotactic virtues or on their similarity to canonical forms. This possibility has been discounted here on the strength of evidence that speakers know not only what are the more common deviations from the norm but also which deviations are more similar to the norm. We have seen that such similarity  knowledge is displayed in rhyming practices and experiments seeking overt similarity judgments. Thus we have discounted the possibility that the available knowledge of similarity remains unlinked to and unexploited by the speakers' system of production.},

(The theory of blocking presented in that paper allows for extremely limited competition: in particular, it is only the underlying representation of individual morphemes that is subject to competition, i.e., competition is restricted to Vocabulary Insertion. There is no competition among complex objects in this theory.)2:The losers of the competition are marked deviant solely because some ``listed'' or ``better'' way of expressing that meaning is found in the language.

Vocabulary Insertion applies only once to a terminal node.8:

Importantly, our metalinguistic analysis of the ungrammatical forms does not imly that these forms play any role in the speaker's competence.

Importantly, our metalinguistic analysis of the ungrammatical forms does not imly that these forms play any role in the speaker's competence.Some functional heads have a restricted distribution and only go with a limited set of Roots. For example, while feminine forms exist for certain nouns, such as \emph{actress} and \emph{lioness} next to \emph{actor} and \emph{lion}, they exist for only a handful of nouns (of the appropriate type: animate and so on). Thus, for any given noun, even of the appropriate semantic class like \emph{jaguar}, one does not expect that the syntax of ``feminine noun'' will necessary be available for that noun. None rules out the structure that would underlie *\emph{jaguaress} as a whole (since forms like \emph{lioness} and \emph{tigress} are possible); but at hte same time there are substantial restrictions on the distribution of the relevant functional heads.

[re: jaguaress] understood here as a particular structure produced by the syntax --- is not created in the first place.

Rules Apply:
Perform a computation when the structural description of the rule is met.

The nature of the objection is conceptual, in the sense that the problem is supposed to be that a ``uniform'' notion of blocking is preferable.

35:

In general, there is no evidence that an apparent gap of this sort in the lexicon improves a conceivable phrasal alternative. On the generative account, this is because the structural constraints on lowering force the operation of merger, so that the phrasal ``alternative'' is never generated in the first place (i.e., there is no phrasal alternative, because the grammar is simply not structured to generate one).

 The apparent ill-formedness of the past tense of \emph{forgo} cannot interact with the structural constraints on merger. In the case of *\emph{forwent}, speakers are confronted by the apparent degraded status of a word generated by the grammar. In such cases, the grammar does not automatically yield an alternative that then emerges as grammatical in some sort of OT computation. In the case of *\emph{intelligenter}, the word is not generated by the grammar.

My analysis of these patterns builds directly on the idea that aspects of perfect formation, in particular whether or not a Root is thematic or athematic in the perfect, is correlated directly with conjugation class features.

If the uniformity constrains always dominat the constraints that would force a change of allomorphs for phonological reasons, there should never be "outward-looking" paradigmatic vacillation. At this point, it is important to recall that there \emph{is} outward-sensitive allomorphy. },

proper definition of suppletion

8:

discussion of german claimed ABA pattern

9 (fn. 8):

I will assume that this is systematically excluded in the course of language acquisition, in other words, while homophony may be posited in general, even within inflectional paradigms, no learner will posit homophonous forms that have not only the same form but also express the same features, differing only in context. Equivalently, if one treats the rules of exponence as rewrite rules, no rule has the form X -> X in some context.

[but what if: universal Priscian derivation]

11 (fn. 13):

Estonian/Finnish counterexample (to Marantz truncation claim?)? 

17:

What these examples show is that suppletion itself is not particularly stable. [it arises, and also it can be replaced by other suppletion]

20:

if there is a context-sensitive rule for some root alpha (alpha -> X / __ [F]) then there is a corresponding context-free rule.

26:

Synthetic-Suppletive Generalization: *Adj_A, more Adj_B

33 (fn. 43):

deadjectival verbs (sans -er, so not <verbessern>) w/ umlaut in the comparative are transitive (and have therefore <sich> intransitives); others are simple intransitives

33 (fn. 44):

analysis modern-er-ize (truncation) [but lower]

40:

This dimension of productivity \ldots seems to be one of the factors that led Osthoff (1888, 1899) to propose the term and notion of suppletion, in place of the previous conception of the conflation of \emph{defective} paradigms.},

	\item $e$ sums to 0
	\item $e$ has a flat spectrum

This is added to the signal $s$ to produce:

$s'$ = 

If this is added to the signal, then the SNR of the output signal is:

\begin{equation}
S/N = \alpha ^ -2

To obtain a signal-correlated additive component, we discard Schroeder's eq. 3d, which reads:

\begin{equation}
e(t_k) \dot s(t_n) = 0
\end{equation}

This asserts that the addtive noise $e$ and the original signal $s$ are uncorrelated.

However, we wish to obtain an additive component $e'$ which is linearly related to the RMS amplitude of $s$ at time $k$, which is given by $R(s_k)$, we define $e'$ as follows (assuming the definitions of $e$ as given by Schroeder):

68: \ldots morphologically conditioned rules (and only such rules --- see \citealt{Anderson1973c}; \citealt{Janda1987}) can effect an exact exchange of two segment types in comparable environments (for example, making long vowels short and short vowels long, without any differentiation of the environments in which the two possibilities occur).
78: On the other hand, even a completely productive process can still, arguably, be derivational, such as the formation of English nominals in \emph{-ing} from Verbs (as in \emph{John's three recent sightings of the yellow-crested titmouse}). We might want to say this is a derivational relation, since it involves a change of lexical category (from Verb to Noun), but it is applicable to any Verb in the language. A high degree of productivity thus does not seem to be either a necessary or a sufficient criterion for calling a morphological category `inflectional.'

224: \ldots{} an advocate of the notion of morphologically conditioned phonological rules might say that in German \emph{Bäume} ``trees'' from \emph{Baum} ``tree,'', we have a phonological rule of Umlaut (by which /au/ $\rightarrow$ /äu/) which is triggered by the plural ending /-\textschwa/; but we can also say that in such forms. the rule for forming the plural does both suffixation and umlaut as part of a single (internally complex) Structural Change. An argument against this claim would be provided if it could be shown that the introduction of, for example, then fintal [\-\textschwa] in German \emph{Bäume} had to take place at one point and the change effected by Umlaut at a distinct stage of the derivation: that is, that some rule required access to a representation in wihch one of these changes had occurred and the other hand not. Examples of this sort seem generally to be lacking, however, and we take this as an argument \emph{ex silentio} for the position taken here.
229: Pike's examples involve juncture-delimited domains as the scope of distributional limitations. Thus, he gives a detailed analysis of constraints on successive vowels in Mixteco morphemes. The limitations that occur within the morpheme are not valid for any phonetically defined domain, however, since these can be morphemically complex.

a.	A conspiracy is a set of rules that are ``functionally related'', i.e. they lead to the same kinds of output configuration such as ``all syllables are open''.
b.	If a language has such a set of rules, then these rules will tend to be surface true, that is, transparent. Otherwise they would not contribute to the ``conspiracy''.
c.	Non-transparent (opaque) rules are not surface true. 
d.	Rules that are not surface true are hard for a learner to learn.
e.	Things that are hard to learn are more likely not to be learned than things which are easy to learn (by definition).
f. Failure to learn aspects of the ambient language constitutes a diachronic change.
g.	Therefore, (E-)languages are more likely to lose a given instance of opacity than gain such an instance of opacity.
h.	Therefore, grammars are likely to look as though they have conspiracies.

17-18: Ridding phonological theory of MSCs is clearly a laudable goal, since such constraints serve merely to state descriptive generalizations about the memorized content of the lexicon of a particular language. Even if we, as linguists, find some generalizations in our description of the lexicon, there is no reason to posit these generalizations as part of the speaker's knowledge of their language, since they are computationally inert and thus irrelevant to the input-output mapping that the grammar is responsible for.

...phonological rules are intentional statements, consistent with the I-language perspective. They cannot be extensional statements, sine speakers are assumed not to store surface forms. The MSCs just redundantly capture facts about the lexicon, which by definition must be extensionally represented as a list.

20: the inventory detected by the learner from the Primary Linguistic Data, together with the Language Acquisition Device, determines the ranking.

24: scholars often offer explanations and propose models and analyses which are largely \emph{inconsistent} with~\ldots~assumptions which they nevertheless continue to avow a belief in'

58:

It is not simply the fact that children ``misarticulate'', since adults frequently do the same, but rather that they produce \emph{systematic} misarticulations.

(These systematic misarticulations, ones attested in no adult grammar and seemingly unmotivated by phonetic markedness concerns [e.g., that clara levelt paper], would seem to be an embarassment for a theory which both seeks to model the surface behaviors of children, and consists of a set of universal phonetic markedness constraints, a fact that seems to have been ignored in the study of ``child phonology''). 

59: 
It seems preferable, a priori, to assume that child and adult grammars are organized by the same computational principles and contain the same sorts of process. If this is an accurate assumption, then it is problematic that certain frequent aspects of ``child phonology'' have long been known to have no parallels in adult phonological systems.

(work on covert contrasts)

73: Richness of the Base \ldots is a claim about the nature of OT grammars which states that there can be great latitude in the form of URs For example, someone with a grammar of English could have all voiceless velar stops stored as clicks. Given the appropriate constraint ranking, viz., with constraints against clicks ranked high, the surface forms could still be pronounced with normal velar stops. But given Smolensky's own assumptions about how parsing and the acquisition of URs proceeds, /k ae t/, for example, could never be stored with a click. 

119:
To support the claim \ldots that ``linguistic objects'' have ``gradedness'' as a property, one would need to show that:

a. there is no level of computation within which phonological (or in syntax, syntactic) features and structures are stroed and manipulated categorically (i.e. non-graident manner);

(fn: Since otherwise \emph{that} level of computation could represent a categorically functioning ``grammar'' in the traditional theoretical sense.)

It is not sufficient to show that: 

b. speakers' and hearers' \emph{judgements} about ``language behavior'' display gradedness (since the content of these judgements is not, in the relevant sense, a linguistic object);

c. observed ``language behavior'' (whether output behavior or behavioral reaction to inputs) displays gradedness, since observed ``language behavior'' is not a linguistic object (in the relevant sense).

121-127:

critique of Hay 2000, chap. 6

137:
Expanding the term ``grammar'' in this way only makes seemingly intriguing statements, such as ``This embedding enables a much richer array of evidence to be used in studies of \emph{grammar} than with classical approaches'' (emphasis added) \ldots incredibly mundane. It is, after all, fairly obvious that if we link some number of additional formal systems to that of the ``competence'' grammar (i.e. the ``grammar'' as that term has been used in late twentieth-century linguistics), e.g. that of planetary motion (call it a ``planetary grammar''), a``much richer array'' of evidence will be used to study ``grammar'' (which term now has been expanded to include the systems which underlie planetary motion). 

(as Hale and Resiss observe, these distinct systems \emph{could} be studied independently. To tie them together formally would predict no strong dissociations between the two, whereas Hale and Reiss review quite a bit of evidence for just such a dissociation.)

(from Zenon: [y]ou can only have a uniform scientific discipline of X if X is a natural domain -- if it includes phenomena that fall under some reasonably uniform set of principles.

We reach for a cup of coffee not because of the coffee in the cup, for there may be no coffee in it after all, but because we believe there to be coffee, or because we see the black stuff there as coffee.)

Two different approaches to eliminating phonologically ill-formed outputs like *[nidd] have been proposed in the literature. One approach uses phonological rules, allowing the morphology to suffix [-d] to [nid], and then repairing the resulting *[dd] cluster by a phonological rule that inserts schwa: /nid+d/ $\rightarrow$ [nid\textschwa d]. Alternatively, in a constraint-based approach, multiple candidate outputs are produced (e.g. [nidd] and [nid\textschwa d]), and some of them are filtered by phonological constraints; thus, a constraint like *[dd] eliminates [nidd].

In either case, it is assumed that the phonologically illegal sequences are already known, prior to morphological learning.

(this turns the words-as-targets-of-acquisition research on its head! cites Hayes for the idea this is reasonable: see Hale and Reiss, chap.~3, for a critique)

In modeling our experimental data, we have found that the constraint-based approach yielded slightly better results \ldots so we adopt it for purposes of the present study. 

(\citet{Borowsky1986} proposes the OCP as blocking rule application. it addresses the problem of deducing the schwa-epenthesis rule \citep[e.g.,][]{Fruehwald2010}, one sort of behavior the Minimum Generalization research program was designed to handle naturally, by fiat. In the case of the OCP, however, parameterization of the OCP (perhaps to different derivational levels) is clearly at play \citep[e.g.:][]{McCarthy1986,Odden1986,Odden1988,Reiss2003,Blevins2005}, so assuming it \emph{a priori} is clearly begging the question, not to mention the fact that other work in this paradigm seems to deny the existence of multi-step derivations

Pinker goes on to suggest various possibilities. A rule like \textsci $\rightarrow$ \textwedge / [X \gap\gap Y]$_{[+{\sc past}]}$ would be too general, because it lacks the phonological context that seems to be affiliated with the change. Thus, Pinker notes that the verbs \emph{fib}, \emph{wish}, and \emph{trip} are regular (cf.~*\emph{fub}, *\emph{wush}, *\emph{trup}). On the other hand, a contextual rule like \textsci $\rightarrow$ \textwedge / [X \gap\gap \textipa{N}]$_{[+{\sc past}]}$ would be too specific, because there is a set of marginal forms that also change [I] to [{ö}], but don't quite meet the crucial condition. For example, \emph{stick}--\emph{stuck} has a final velar consonant, but it is not nasal; \emph{spin}-\emph{spun} has a final nasal consonant, but it is not velar. Pinker concludes that rules are fundamentally unable to capture irregular processes; instead, they must be derived by a mechanism that relies on prototypicality and family resemblance.

(Though Albright and Hayes valiantly reject the false dichtomy apparent in rules vs. analogy, and even wiser, reject Pinker's incoherent attempt at synthesis, they can be said to create, or at least validate, a false dichtomy between phonology and listed behavior.)

129 (footnote 7):

Pinker also objects to \textsci $\rightarrow$ \textwedge / [X \gap\gap \textipa{N}]$_{[+{\sc past}]}$ because the forms bring-brought and spring-sprang would be exceptions to it. This strikes us as inconsistent with a position he adopts elsewhere, namely, that languages have rules for regular processes even when these rules suffer from exceptions. We see no reason why a stricter standard should be maintained for rules describing irregular processes.

\citet[cf.][?]{Yang2010}

We feel that this conclusion is premature, and holds only of more traditional rule-based accounts

(for which they cite Halle and Mohanan. In those theories, irregular rules are done by list: while they seem to concur with Pinker that there is phonological content to speakers' identification environments for irregularity. What is lacking is strong evidence that what is needed is not just stochastic rules (cf.~Yang2002, chap.~3, and Dunbar 2008), but also overlapping rules).

We assume that the candidate output is assigned the well-formedness score of the best rule that derives it.

134:

If a verb falls into an island of reliability for irregular pasts (e.g. \emph{spling}-\emph{splung}), will it receive higher ratings? 

If a verb falls into an island of reliability for regular pasts (e.g. \emph{blafe}-\emph{blafed}), will it receive higher ratings?

Prasada and Pinker's [1993--KG] experiments were intended to show, we think, that the answer to question (13a) is ``yes'' (replicating Bybee \& Moder, 1983), and the answer to question (13b) is ``no''.

34: [great passage about introspection]
36-37: {\ldots}the points of the cortex are surely not correlated with specific socialyl significant features of speech such as words or synta; this appear plainly from the fluctuating and contradictory results of the search for various kinds of ``speech centers.''{\ldots}The error of seeking correlations between anatomically defined parts of the nervous system and socially defined activities appears clearly when we see some physiologists looking for a ``visual word-center'' which is to control reading and writing: one might as well look for a specific brain-center for telegraphy or automobile-driving or th use of any modern invention. 
37: If we found it possible and worth while to register every specific utterance in a large community, we sohuld doubtless be able to foretell how many times any given utterance such as \emph{Good-morning} or \emph{I love you} or \emph{How much are oranges today?} would be spoken within a fixed number of days. A detailed study of this kind would tell us a geat deal, especially about the changes that are constantly going on in every languages.
38: The observer who, by this mass-observation, gives us a statement of the speech-habits of a community, can tell us nothing about the changes which are going on in the language of this as of every community. These changes could be observed only by means of genuinely statistical observation through a considerable length of time; for want of this, we are ignorant of many matters concerning linguistic change. 
{\ldots}language is the simplest and most fundamental of our social (that is, peculiarly human) activities. 
43: {\ldots}if we had records, we should doubtless find very few persons whose ancestors of a few generations ago all spoke the same language. What concerns us most, however, is the fact that the features of a language are not inherited in the biologic sense. A child cries out at birth and would doubtless in any case after a time take to gurgling and babbling, but the particular language he learns is entirely a matter of environment.

54: In sum, the term \emph{speech-community} only has a relative value. The possibility of communication between groups, or even between individuals, ranges all the way from zero up to the most delicate adjustment. It is evident that the intermediate degrees contribute very much to human welfare and progress. 
212: syllabic analysis of English inflection (parallel to \emph{is})
213: We can make our general statement cover one group, but will then have to furnish a \emph{list} of the cases that do not fall under the general statement. A set of forms that is not covered by a genrael statement, but has to be presented in the form of a list, is said to be \emph{irregular}. We try, of course, to arrange our description so that as many forms as possible will be included in general statements.

Voiced /\textezh/ provides exactly such a case. Speakers of German readily accept this fricative, for example, in \emph{Genie}, \emph{Garage}, \emph{Orange}. There seems to be no tendency to assimilate /\textezh/ to the system of more native sounds. On teh other hand, the nasalized vowels, which are borrowed from French, and probably in a larger number of words than /\textezh/, rarely occur in normal speech. These words are readily assimlated, usually in such a way that the non-nasalized vowel plus the velar nasal [\textipa{N}] is used instead of the nasalized vowel.

To counter possible alternative proposals to that given here, one may add that this particular type of word formation with \emph{+ei} is very productive. All roots with the right (semantic and proposdic) properties apparently can undergo this suffixation. [footnote omitted] Lexically listing all words of this type thus does not appear to be a viable alternative. Moreover, it is also not plausible to assume that the prosodic structure required for the base is part of the lexical entries for stems (and not derived by rule), since, first, it is totally predictable, and second, some rule to change this structure would then be required for words such as \emph{Segl+er}, where the root appears in a monosyllabic shape.

5: Another kind of idealization generally made by linguists has crept into the preceding -- the notion that the individual segments of sepeech referred to above can be characterized in isolation from their surroundings. In fact, the vocal organs are all continually in motion, and at any given point in time, they are likely to be executing gestures assocaited not with one but with several of the segments of the utterance. 
6: ...it can still be asked what theoretical justification we have for making the segmental abstraction. The only justification that can be given is a pragmatic one; such a description, based on a segmental structure imposed on the event by the analyst, has been the basis of virtually every result of note that has ever been obtained in the field of linguistic phonetics or phonology. As such, it will continue to be employed until some deficiency is pointed out, in the form of a linguistically significant generalization that is essentially unstatable if the procedure of segmentation is adhered to. It is fairly clear what sort of situation would furnish such evidence, and it is interesting to note that some recent research in the area (appropriately enough) of suprasegmental phonology indicates a need for some revision of our notion of the segment. [footnote omitted] By and large, however, phonetic segmentation is as satisfactory a means of representing an utterance as the standard sort of musical score is for representing the structure of an orchestral work. 
15: Of course, a third view is also possible, to the effect that the phonemes of a language have no phonetic properties, whatsoever, and are purely abstract, algebraic, theoretical entities with a correspondence to phonetic segments that is essentially arbitrary. This last possibility (which is arguably the position of Hjelmslev and Lamb) is not discussed at any length here since it has been adequately dealt with elsewhere \ldots
20: \ldots it is clear from his practice that Boas' descriptive statements were never intended to account for any deviation between `basic' forms and `phonetic' forms except that required by alternations. In his treatment of \emph{c} in Dakota \citep{Boas1941}, the possibility of deriving \emph{all} instances of \emph{c} from \emph{k} is ignored, and \emph{c} is only related to \emph{k} in cases where a morpheme appears in two shapes, one with \emph{k} and one with \emph{c}. 
21: \ldots the phonetic segment inventory could be divided into two classes: the phonemes, and the variants.
27-28: It was largely taken from granted that native speakers would agree that, e.g., the two pronunciations of \emph{ration} are not repetitions of one another, though both mean the same thing; and that .e.g, \emph{pear} and \emph{pair} would be identified as repetitions, despite the fact they mean different things. \ldots This notion of contrast was generally assuemd by taxonomic phonemicists, although it shoudl perhaps be notd that it, too, falls down in both directions. On the one hand, it is well known that native speakers often feel there is a difference in two forms, where no objective phonetic difference exists, if their morphological composition is different. Thus, many speakers feel there is some difference between, say, \emph{bard} and \emph{barred}, though no difference exists for most speakers. [Mention of Sapir's ``...reality of phonemes'']
28: A different sort of failure of this notion of contrast has recently been noted by \citet{Labov1972}: he cites seeral instances in which informants claimed two forms were repetitions, when in fact there turned out to be a consistent phonetic difference between them. 
29 (Bloomfield and Sapir didn't believe in simultaneous application): This last condition applies the requirement that all of the statements relating phonemic representation to phonetic representation apply simultaneously, that is, it can never be the case that one statement requires information which is only provided by the operation of another statement. This condition of simultaneous application, which was generally adhered to in taxonomic analysis, is directly contrary to the kind of phonemic-phonetic relation expressly envisioned by Sapir (and, less explictly, by the grammarians of the ``Handbook of American Indian Languages,'') which allowed some rules to apply to the output of other rules. 
33 (Swadesh and Voegelin use a morphophoneme /F/ to get knife/knives, etc.): An item such as []F[] was not intended to have \emph{any} phonetic interpretation directly, but only through the medium of the phonemic interpretation of the formula defining it. []F[], in other words, is a purely arbitrary element, standing for /f/ in some environments and /v/ in others, but without any phonetic interpretation of its own. \ldots Other early morphophonemic elements often abbreviated alternations between elements with no discernible phonetic coherence, the only condition being that the elements were in complementary distribution, the fact that one occurred in some environments, while the other occurred in distinct ones. Since it was nothing but a linguist's device, there was no reason whatsoever to expect a morphophoneme to have a coherent and natural definition.
52: Of course it would be possible, in principle, for all of a speaker's knowledge of the sound structure of the elements of his language to be characterized by a gargantuan list \ldots giving explicitly each of the elemnts that could possibly occur in phonetic representations of utterances in the language. It would be impossible, we should note, to characterize a speaker's knowledge of the syntactic structures of his language in this way, in light of the recursive (and therefore potentially unlimited) nature of the syntactic system he knows. A language contains a finite number of distinct lexical items, however, and each of these occurs in a finite number of morphological environments; this it is at least possible that these could simply be memorized as a list. If this were a true description of the nature of phonological knowledge, the linguist could simply give up and go to the beach \ldots
71: Several recent papers \ldots have claimed that phonological theory can predict all ordering relationships in a grammar. This seems much too strong; and indeed, it is not particularly plausible, in the face of the full rnage of arbitrary and ad hoc facts presented by virtually any natural language when taken in its entirety. It is only when one focuses on a narrow collection of facts, chosen specifically for their general and interesting nature, that such a claim has even surface plausibility.

253: Just as many (although not all) of the facts traditionally ascribed to phonotactics turn out on further examination to be the mechanical consequences of independently motivated phonological rules \ldots

255: \citet{Haugen1956}, for example, gives an argument that shows the necessity of including syllabels as units in underlying representations. He shows that in Kutenai, the constraints on medial clusters are by no means arbitrary: a possible medial  cluster is essentially a possible (syllable-) final cluster followed by a possible (syllable-) initial cluster.
Chapter 13: find eligible segments-environments and circle them. If any circled segment is contained in some other circled segment's environment, uncircle and forget about the environments of the smallest possible number of segments that will get rid of these overlaps. then simultaneously apply.
283: There are, of course, numerous regularities in any language that can be stated quite satisfactorily in terms of a characterization of (surface) forms, without taking into account a system of rules the primary concern of which is to specify the alternate shapes in which a morpheme occurs in different environments. It is interesting to note however that many of these intramorphemic regularities are expressed perfectly adequately within the system of rules, without the need for another set of statements. In Russian, for instance, we have noted that the feature of voicing is nondistinctive in all but the last member of a cluster of obstruents. This might be expresed in terms of a `phonotactic' description of the class of possible obstruent clusters in Russian surface forms. Alternations such as [dat'l'i] versus [dad'bi], however, show that we need a rule in the grammar to assimilate the voicing of an obstruent to that of a following one. This rule of assimilation will state perfectly satisfactorily the fact that a cluster of obstruents disagreeing on the feature [$\pm$ \textsc{Voice}] cannot appear in Russian phonetic forms, and no additional `phonotactic' statement is needed. 
While this is true of a great many regularities that obtain entirely within the bounds of an underlying unit, it is not (unfortunately) true of all. It would be a result of the greatest interest if it were to turn out that every intramorphemic regularity was necessarily reflected in an alternation, and thus in a rule; but this position cannot seriously be maintained.

	Annote = {ix: We see no reason to give up rules of greater generality because they are not of even greater generality, to sacrifice generality where it can be attained. It seems hardly necessary to stress that if we are faced with a choice between a grammar G$_1$ that contains a general rule along with certain special rules governing exceptions and a grammar G$_2$ that gives up the general rule and lists everything as an exception, then we will prefer G$_1$. For this reason, citation of exceptions is in itself of very little interest. For this reason, citation of exceptions is in itself of very little interest. Counterexamples to a grammatical rule are of interest only if they lead to the construction of a new grammar of even greater generality or if they show some underlying principle is fallacious or misformulated.
	We stress this point because of what seems to us a persistent misinterpretation, in linguistic discussion, of the significance of exceptions to rules---a misinterpretation which in part reflects a deeper misunderstanding as to the status of grammars or of linguistic theory. A grammar is a theory of language. It is obvious that any theory of a particular language or any generaly theory of language that can be proposed today will be far from adequate, in scope and in depth. One of the best reasons for presenting a theory of a particular language in the precise form of a generative grammar, or for presenting a hypothesis of concerning general linguistic theory in very explicit terms, is that only such precise and explicit formulation can lead to the discovery of serious inadequacies and to an understanding of how they can be remedied.

65: As phonetic parameters, the distinctive features provide a representation of an utterance which can be interpreted as a set of instructions to the physical articulatory system, or as a refined level of perceptual representation. The major function of the phonological component is to derive the phonetic reprsentation of an utterance from the surface structure assigned to it by the syntactic component...

172: It is quite obvious that many of the phonological rules of the language will have certain exceptions which, from the point of view of the synchronic description, will be quite arbitrary. This is no more surprirsing than the fact that there exist strong verbs or irregular plurals. Phonology, being essentially a finite system, can tolerate some lack of regularity (exceptions can be memorized); being a highly intricate system, resulting (very strikingly, in a language like English) from diverse and interwoven historical processes, it is to be expected that a margin of irregularity will persist in almost every aspect of the phonological description.

Clearly, we must design our linguistic theory in such a way that the existence of exceptions does not prevent the systematic formulation of those regularities that remain ... Finally an overriding consideration is that the evaluation measure must be designed in such a way that the wider and more varied the clas of exceptions, the less highly valued is the grammar

380: Certain `nonsense' forms are so close to English that they might be taken by the speaker to be accidental gaps in his knowledge of the language.
382: \ldots{}regularities are observed within lexical items as well as across certain boundaries---the rule governing voicing of obstruent sequences in Russian, for example---and to avoid duplication of such rules it is necessary to regard them not as redundancy rules but as phonological rules that also happen to apply internally to a lexical item\ldots{}in the case of duplication of redundancy rules and P rules, only the P rules should be written. 
417: Given a lexicon L, which determines a set of interpreted lexical matrices of the form (15), we can define the ``distance'' from L of a lexical matrix $\mu$ in the following way. Let us say that rule (16) \emph{distinguishes} $\mu$ from L if (16) does not change any member of L (i.e., given \emph{v} \in L, either (16) is inapplicable to \emph{v} or it leaves \emph{v} unaltered) but (16) does change $\mu$; and furthermore, (16) is minimal in that any other rule meeting these conditions contains at least as many features F specified [$+$F] or [$-$F] as does (16):

(16) $$X \rightarrow Y / Z \gap\gap W$$

Let us define the distance of $\mu$ from L as $1 / n$, where $n$ is the number of features specified as [$+$F] or [$-$F] in a rule that distinguishes $\mu$ from L in this sense. Where the distance is undefined in this way (there being no such rule), let us say that it is zero. 

For example, let L be the lexicon of English and consider the distance of /brik/, /blik/, /bnik/, /bnzk/ from L. The distance of /brik/ from L is zero since there is no rule distinguishing it from L. The distance of /blik/ from L is 1/17 since the minimal rule distinguishing /blik/ from L is (17), which has 17 specified features. The distance of /bnik/ from L is 1/5, since the distinguishing rule is (18). The distance of /bnzk/ from L is 1/4 since the distinguishing rule is (19)

[$+$\textsc{Cons}] $\rightarrow$ [$-$\textsc{Lateral}] / [$-$\textsc{seg}] [$+$\textsc{Cons}, $-$\textsc{Voc}, $+$\textsc{Ant}, $-$\textsc{Cor}, $+$\textsc{Voice}] \_\_\_ [$+$\textsc{High}, $-$\textsc{Back}, $-$\textsc{Tense}] [$+$\textsc{Cons}, $-$\textsc{Voc}, $-$\textsc{Ant}, $-$\textsc{Cor}, $-$\textsc{Cont}, $-$\textsc{Voice}]

(18) 

[$+$\textsc{Cons}] $\rightarrow$ [$-$\textsc{Nasal}] / [$-$\textsc{seg}] [$+$\textsc{Cons}, $-$\textsc{Cont}] \_\_\_

(19) 

[$+$\textsc{Seg}] $\rightarrow$ [$+$\textsc{Voc}] / [$+$\textsc{Cons}] [$+$\textsc{Nasal}] \gap\gap

In short, to determine the distance of a matrix $\mu$ from L, we find the simplest rule which is ``true of L,'' in the obvious sense, but not true of $\mu$, and we take the distance of $\mu$ from L to be inversely related to the complexity of this rule. This measure of distance can be refined in various ways. For example, certain distinguishing rules may be universal and may be taken as defining an absolute ``maximal'' distance; we can take into account the natural hierarchy of features discussed on page 410 and consider the position of $X$ in (16) in this hierarchy of determining distance, etc. Furthermore, we can assign special status to rules that make use of ``natural'' environments, such as ``initial cluster,'' ``vocalic nucleus,'' etc. Without going into these and other refinements, however, it is clelar even from the very simple examples given that an interesting and linguistically significant characterization of ``degree of phonological admissibility'' can be given in quite general terms, even if grammars contain no redundancy rules. We feel, therefore, that the proposed measure of distance is an improvement over the tripartite categorization that was discussed in earlier treatments of this problem, although it still falls short of providing a fully adequate explication of phonological admissibility.},

	Annote = {44: An even more curious demonstration comes from families of words with the same stem and different prefixes. Words with prefixes keep the past-tense form of the stem: \emph{eat}--\emph{ate} becomes \emph{overeat}--\emph{overate}; \emph{make}--\emph{made} becomes \emph{remake}--\emph{remade}. This is not surprising, because we all hear the \emph{eat} inside \emph{overeat}---overating is, after all, as kind of eating, namely, eating too much. What \emph{is} surprising is that the same thing happens when the meaning of the combination is opaque. Few people sense the meaning of the \emph{stand} inside \emph{understand}, the \emph{get} inside \emph{forget}, or the \emph{come} inside \emph{become}. Nonetheless no one is tempted to say \emph{understanded}, \emph{forgetted}, or \emph{becomed}; the irregular forms persist, giving us \emph{understood}, \emph{forgot}, and \emph{became}. 
45: Moreover, it is not pure sound that carries the irregular form: The past of \emph{succumb} and \emph{encumber} are \emph{succumbed} and \emph{encumbered}, not \emph{succame} and \emph{encamber}, because people don't perceive them as containing a prefix followed by the word \emph{come}, only the sound [k^m]. 
48: They may fail to discern the rationale for a rule and simply memorize its output as a list. Or they may latch on to some habitual way of ordering words and hypothesize a new rule to make sense of it. 
60: I know how to spell \emph{banana}, but I don't know when to stop.
(scheme theory of zero preterites)
Perhaps the suffix \emph{-d} is applied, and the unproduceable result, \emph{hitd}, is cleaned up, not by the ordinary phonological rule that inserts a neutral vowel between the \emph{t} and \emph{d}, but by a special rule that deletes the \emph{d}.
61: new zeros: \emph{bust}, \emph{pet}, \emph{shred}, \emph{tread}

cling, clung, fling, sling, sting, swing, wring, slink, stick, dig, spin, win
run
hang
strike
sneak
sit, split
77: death of \emph{shrank}
90: [right stuff metaphor]
The past tense is the only case I know in which [THE--KG] two great systems of Western thought may be tested and compared on a single rich set of data, just like ordinary scientific hypotheses. 
90f.: It didn't have to be that way. One can imagine a hypothetical language in which most of the verbs are like \emph{go}-\emph{went}, which nothing in common between stem and past, each stem and each past stuffed into its own memory slot. We need an explanation of why English does not look like that. 
91: Second, a few kinds of change from a step to its past are seen over and over among the 164 irregular verbs. ... One can imagine a language in which every verb picked its own substitution of vowels and consonants from among hte thousands that are logically possible. But generations of learners have passed down an English language that is verb different from that possibility. 
97f.: In other words, they claim that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny...
100: And the suggestion that English-speaking children hear \emph{run} and infer \emph{rin} or hear \emph{fight} and infer the German-sounding \emph{f\=echt} is, frankly, beyond belief. 
101: It's different with sentences, where the child needs rules to generate an infinite number of new ones; with word roots, there are only a finite number to learn.

But perhaps the biggest problem is that the Chomsky-Halle-Mohanan theory cannot explain the third kind of similarity running through the irregulars: the similarities among stems, as in \emph{sting}, \emph{string}, \emph{sling}, \emph{stink}, \emph{sink}, \emph{swing} , and \emph{spring}.
125: *\emph{Stridden} hovers in the mists of memory, tainting \emph{strided} without stepping onto the stage itself. 
126: forgo, dig2, bit2 
206: But when we correlated the number of [phonologically similar regulars] of a [irregular] verb with its error rate in children's speech, we found little to no effect.
213: Zoschschenko
215: It is no coincidence that people generalize \emph{-ed} and  that most verbs in English take \emph{-ed}, the connectionsts say; people, like pattern associators, go with the numbers.},

The relationship between sound change and analogy has often been characterized in terms of the following paradox: `Regular sound change creates morphological irregularity, because it applies without consideration for morphological factors. Analogy, an inherently irregular process, attempts to reestablish morphological regularity.'

But it is doubtful whether simplicity and clearer marking are sufficient to make a formation productive \ldots

179:

overlap between four-part analogy and leveling

211-2:

Kurylowicz's first law: A bipartite marker tends to replace an isofunctional morpheme consisting of only one of these elements, i.e. a complex marker replaces a simple marker

212-222:

Kurylowicz's second law: Analogical developments follow the direction `basic form' $\rightarrow$ `derived form', where the relationship between basic and derived forms is a consequence of their spheres of use. 

Hock's interpretation: just means analogy as rule extension; he doesn't imagine extension as extension of zero, though. "sphere of usage" idea refers to scope. 

223-227:

Kurylowicz's fourth law: When as a consequence of a morphological change, a form undergoes differentiation, the new form takes over its primary (`basic') function, the old form remains only in secondary (`derived') function. 

Hock's interpretation: interesting appeal from bracketing paradoxes against this

64-65: claim that rhotacism leveling affected masculine and feminine polysyllables, rhotacism continued to operate in monosyllables and neuters, vowels shortened before final consonants, in 1965, it was claimed that was a reanalysis of the stem, however he forgot some of the "changing stems" retain s in derivatives,  (but honestus is a fake verb), idea is that s -> r operates in some nominatives too
68: Grammatically conditioned variability in the application of optional rules favors optimal outputs...For example, we would not expect to find a dialect of English in which plural \emph{-s} drops MORE often than genitive or third singular \emph{-s}. 
78: "Still, everyone would grant that there is a real levelling here. 
is obvious that the new paradigm in some sense shows `less allomorphy'
than the old one.''
99-100: and there are some problems with the vowel of the stem (why \emph{-e-} in \emph{honestus}?). Nevertheless, it seems likely that the adjectives were felt to be synchronically related to the corresponding nouns. 
older /hon+\=os/, later /hon+\=or/\
if we eliminate rhotacism, "we need some other rule, otherwise
unnecessary, which turns \emph{r} to \emph{s} before certain
consonantal suffixes."

101: The effect of paradigm leveling is also produced by simplification of the structural analysis and by that type of reordering which eliminates a bleeding order 

112: three-consonant clusters, adjacent stresses, and so on, are linguistically complex configurations, and rules eliminating or avoiding them are accordingly highly natural and occur frequently in the languages of the world. It is therefore only to be expected that there should be some languages in which several rules should eliminate or avoid these configurations, and that there should be languages in which no instances of these configurations appear on the surface \ldots What I am questioning, then, is whether there is any fundamental sort of difference between the cases in which just one or two rules reflect general phonological conditions of this type, and the cases in which several rules are involved, which would be termed a `conspiracy'.
Concrete empirical differences are clearly also involved: for example, is there any evidence for a true `functional unity' of the rules in a conspiracy which would not simply be characterizable by their sharing a common target? Are there cases in which they are subject to parallel historical changes at some point in the development of a language? Are there cases in which apparently diverse changes in the rules of a language at some point in time can be shown to be consequences of the imposition of a single derivational constraint? Are there cases where the rules in a conspiracy have the same set of lexical exceptions? This would be strong evidence in favor of derivational constraints. However, I have not found any such cases.

(b) P8 is suspended unless P8A is Yes, so these together also have 3 
values. 
(c) If P5 is QI, unbounded feet become vacuous, so P2 must be Binary; 
so P2 with P5-6 allows 5 rather than 6 possibilities. 
(d) We assume that P7 requires P5 QS. Also, if P7 is Yes, then there 
is no observable difference between binary and unbounded feet. 
We will stipulate that P2 B is not available with P7 Yes; so P7 
together with P2-P5-P6 has 7 values. 
(e) P3 is suspended when P2 is U; P4 is also suspended when P7 is Yes

Another possibility, suggested in Clark (1990), is that tone features are under the Laryngeal node, and  therefore are segmentatal features. This view runs into many problems...However, the laryngeal tone theory draws some support from the fact that tone interacts with laryngeal features in synchronic phonologies. The phonetically expected interaction is for voiceless obstruents to ``act like'' they have H tone, and for voiced obstruents to ``act lke'' they have L tone. This may be manifested in a number of ways. Spreading of H in Bade (Chadic: Nigeria) is blocked by voiced obstruents (Schuh 1978a):

(examples here)

In Nupe, (Kwa: Nigeria), L spreading is blocked by voiceless obstruents (George 1970).

(examples here)

If complete identification of tonal and phonatory features were made, in such a way that the feature for voicing \emph{is} the feature for L tone and the feature for voicelessness is the feature for H tone, then such effects could be explained in terms of the ban against crossing association lines.},

Marked structures have to be learned on the basis of slender evidence too, so there should be further structure to the system outside of core grammar. We might expect that the structure of these further systems relates to the theory of core grammar by such devices as relaxing certain conditions of core grammar, processes of analogy in some sense to be made precise, and so on, though there will presumably be independent structure as well. (p.~8)

...

How do we delimit the domain of core grammar as distinct from marked periphery? In principle, one would hope that evidence from language acquisition would be useful with regard to determining the nature of the boundary or the propriety of the distinction in the first place, since it is predicted that the systems develop in quite different ways.

On radio and television, stereotypes of middle class and working class New York speech have traditionally been used for comic effects. For many years, several other features of working class and lower class New York City speech have been stigmatized under the label of Brooklynese. In Minnesota or Pittsburgh, the speech of lower class New Yorkers may be imitated by boys who think of this style as a symbol of the tough, hard life and defiance of authority. Indeed, some of these sound features have entered into a folk mythology.

"Wh-Criterion: In earlier work, Rizzi proposed that wh-movement is driven by 
the Wh-Criterion, which essentially requires that a wh-phrase 
(carrying the feature [wh]) must end up in a Spec-head relation 
with C (also carrying the feature [wh] in questions).*

*More or less. Actually Rizzi argues that T carries [wh] and that T moves to C (bringing [wh] along with it), where the wh-phrase can enter a Spec-head relation by moving to SpecCP. "

p. 158
"An alternative is to propose that the verb is base generated with the negative prefix. Some suggesive support might be that Old English had negative verbs: nylle and nolde are the persent and past tense of the negated willan ('want'), the negative forms also include an imperative, nelle is the singular form, nellad the plural. Similary there is a negative form of wesan (be), habban (have) and of witan ('know') etc. Under such a view nie [from WF, me], might be in (Spec,NegP) and teh negative inflecetd V woudld beunder a lower head....

165: \citet{Jespersen1917} suggests that there is a correlation betewen the availability of an overt negative head and the availability of NC which might suggest that NC depends no the availability of an overt negative head. 
Zanuttini (1989 [from glow]) offers a similar account. However, there is no general correlation between NC and teh presence of an overt Neg0. The Bavarian dialect of German, or instance, lacks an overt negative head and yet it has NC (Bayer); in WF and in French, Nc is available regardless of teh overt realization of teh negative head. 

p. 181
negation triggers inversion, but only if it's sentential. sententia negation is neg0. the other things are adjunct phrases.

p. 189
i assume that not occupies [Spec,NegP]. In (34a) sentential negation is expressed by n't:

john hasn't left yet.

The most natural analysis is to assume that n't is teh overt realization of neg0. its head status is confirmed by teh fact that it is moved along with the inflected aux etc.

e. Has john not left? (only in british english)

not only has john not
looks like RESIDUE to me. what about with lex verbs earlier on?

Why not  "didn't not john go?" then? parallel to ne pas right?

of sonority." Previous work by Mermelstein suggests that this intuition is nearly true on the acoustic surface of speech, and that relatively crude algorithms based on amplitude variation can work fairly well at counting syllables and locating their approximate extent. We have devised a simple speaker-independent algorithm for detecting sonority peaks in continuuous speech, and tested it accuracy as a syllable finder on several paragraphs of casual reading by four speakers. Performance was encouraging: less than 10% misses, and less than 1% false triggers. The misses were about evenly divided among (1) vowel-vowel transition, where no sonority minimum is expected, (2) intervocatic sonorants with insufficient amplitude dip, and (3) devoiced or deleted schwa. Methds for dealing with these cases will be discussed.},

This kind of interaction of two syntactic phenomena is accounted for straightforwardly on the assumption that negative preposing was par t of the grammatical system rather than some relatively superficial stylistic reordering phenomenon or archaic residue.

Overall, negated subject displacement to Spec NegP was actually more common than canonical positioning of a negated subject until the 1470s, after which data are lacking. There was no evidence of a decline in their frequency in the 1460s and 1470s, when OV with negated objects de- clined. Whether this counts against the position taken in this ar ticle---that the two constructions are related---is a point we return to later.

"Aside from a few potentially formulaic utterances, then, OV order was thus al- 
most entirely restricted to a position embraciated by a tensed auxiliary and a 
nonfinite lexical verb.

Since negated objects occupied Spec NegP, regardless of whether the clause contained a nonfinitive verb, negative concord could not take place either in clauses with finite lexical verbs. And in fact no cases of the type *I found not no person were 
found among many dozens of instances of negated objects in clauses containing 
a single finite lexical verb.},

A serious weakness in the empirical foundations of the various theories of linguistic change considered here stems from their automatic reliance upon cognitive functions as the prime determinant of linguistic behavior. The assumption that perception was determined by contrastive (morph-distinguishing) units was never based upon a sound empirical foundation, but rather upon a large number of uncontrolled (anecdotal) observations of cases where perception did not match phonemic categories. A growing body of evidence from controlled sociolinguistic studies indicates that perception is indeed controlled by linguistic structure, but it is a structure which includes not only units defined by contrastive function but also units defined by their stylistic role, and their power to identify the speaker's membership in a specific subgroup of the community.},

I tried to construct a system of rules for generating the phonetic form of sentences, that is, what is now called a generative grammar. I thought it might be possible to devise a system of recursive rules to describe the form and structure of sentences ... and thus perhaps to achieve the kind of explanatory force that I recalled from historical grammar. I had in mind such specific examples as the following. The Hebrew root \emph{mlk} (``king'') enters into such forms as \emph{malki} (``my king'') \emph{malk}a (``queen''), \emph{mlaxim} (``kings''). The change of \emph{k} to \emph{x} in \emph{mlaxim} results from a general process of spirantization in post-vocalic position. But consider the construct state form \emph{malxey} (``kings of''). Here we have \emph{x} in a phonological context in which we would expect \emph{k} (cf.~\emph{malki}, \emph{malka}). The anomaly can be explained if we assume that spirantization preceded a process of vowel reduction that converted \emph{malaxim} to \emph{mlaxim} and \emph{malaxey}-X (``kings of X,'' where X contains the main stress) to \emph{malxey}-X. The processes of spirantization and reduction (generally, antepretonic) are motivated independently, and by assuming the historical order to be spirantization-reduction, one can explain the arrangement of forms \emph{malki}, \emph{malka}, \emph{malxey}, \emph{mlaxim}. It seemed only natural to construct a synchronic grammar with ordering of rules such as spirantization and reduction to explain the distribution of existing forms. Pursuing this idea, I constructed a detailed grammar, concentrating on the rules for deriving phonetic forms from abstract morpho-phonemic representations. },

	Annote = {As noted by \citet{Hayes1995}, stress in English is culiminative on not just the word level, but also higher levels of representation. The predictions made by a relational-derivational theory of stress assignment is such that culiminitivy at each level will be expressed in strengthening strong syllables, and weakening already-weak syllables \citet{liberman1977}. This follows from the principle of stress rule construction - they do not reduce stress numerically, but rather only in relation to other stronger constituents. This has the potential to alter phonetic realization of main stress in words in English; the notion of culiminitivity at the word-level is a result of the phenomenon of main word-stress (but does not strengthen it), and higher levels of culimintivity (at the prosodic, clausal, etc. level) strengthen evidence for main stress for the strongest syllables in the culminitivity constituent. 

The fact that, for example, French stress is not necessarily culiminative at the word-level (which Hayes analyzes as parametric variation in the lowest level of culimativity active in a grammar) predicts that an algorithm for word segmentation based on main stress potentially run into problems. We predict, then, that French children learning to segment would likely run into errors caused by the phrasal level being the lowest level of culiminivity, and in fact this is confirmed by ....},

Faced with this massive statistical regularit,y you have two alternatives. Either you can assume that it reflects some universal property of the human mind, or you can assume that it represents some necessary consequence of the laws of probability. Zipf chose the synthetic hypothesis and searched for a principle of least effort that would explain the apparent equilibrium between uniformity and diversity in our own words. Most others who were subsequently attracted to the problems chose the analytic hypothesis and searched for a probablistic explanation. Now, thirty years later, it seems clear that the others were right. Zipf's curves are merely one way to express a necessary consequence of regarding a message source as a stochastic process. 

Put it this way. Suppose that we acquired a dozen monkeys and chained them to typewriters until they had produced some very long and random sequence of characters. Suppose furtehr that we defined a ``word'' in this monkey-text as any sequence of letters occurring between successive spaces. And suppose finally that we counted the occurrences of these ``words'' in just the way Zipf and others counted the occurrences of real words in meaningful text. When we plot our results in the same manner, we will find exactly the same ``Zipf curves'' for the monkeys as for the human authors. Since we are not likely to argue that the poor monkeys were searching for some equilibrium between uniformity and diversity in expressing their ideas, such explanations seem equally inappropriate for human authors. 

A mathematical rationalization for this result has been provided by Benoit Mandelbrot. The crux of it is that if we assume that word-boundary markers (spaces) are scattered randdomyl through a text, then there will necessarily be more occurrences of short than long words. Add to this fact the further observation that the variety of different words available increases exponentially with their length and the phenomenon Zipf reported becomes inescapable: a few short words will be used an enormous number of times while a vast number of longer words will occur infrequently or not at all.
