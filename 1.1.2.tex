\subsubsection{The duplication problem}

\citeauthor{Anderson1974} sees the duplication of \textsc{Backness Harmony} as both sequence structure constraint and phonological rule as a foregone conclusion
.The tendency of sequence structure constraints to duplicate phonological rules was noted by \citet[][401f.]{Stanley1967} and in \emph{SPE} (p.~382) in the discussion of morpheme structure constraints, and is labeled ``the duplication problem'' by \citet[][?]{Kenstowicz1977}.
