\chapter{Sequence structure constraints in generative grammar}
\label{msc}

The first part of this text concerns the empirical substance of the theory of \textsc{Morpheme Structure Constraints} (MSCs), that is, language-specific constraints on the shapes of morphs stored in lexical memory.
Evidence is presented to support the claim that such constraints are solely derived by other components of grammar, and do not have an ontology of their own.

The first section of this chapter outlines a brief history of MSCs.
The following section draws upon this material to present the above claim as a null hypothesis, and presents conditions for falsifying it.
The final section outlines the remainder of Part I (chapters 2--4), which present evidence in support of this hypothesis.

% it is not clear what follows from a phonotactic description
% pater on NC
% can't be right tho, see stanley, kisseberth, clayton, shibatani, hooper, etc.
