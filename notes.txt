Imagine a word $W$ from some donor language borrowed into a recipient language as $W'$. For the sake of simplicity, I further assume speakers of both languages are monolingual and that the contact is not in any way mediated by writing. There are many possible explanations for a nonvacuous function mapping $W$ to $W'$. 

In many cases, $W$ is the target of one or more synchronic processes in the source language and $W'$ is the expected outcome. These synchronic processes can give rise to the adaptation under the assumption that $W$ is perceived faithfully by speakers of the recipient language, and thus set up as the UR for the loanword. Naturally, the application of the synchronic processes will produce outputs of $W'$. Unless new alternations are introduced, speakers who are not in contact with the donor language will treat $W'$ as the UR. Any instance of this account can be falsified by showing that the synchronic processes used to characterize the adaptation are incorrect characterizations of the recipient language.

In such a case, the relation of $W$ to $W'$ might instead represent lossy perception of $W$ as $W'$ by speakers of the recipient language \citep[e.g.,][]{Halle1998b,Dupoux1999,Peperkamp2008}, in which case the speakers of the recipient language have no access to $W'$. However, it is not at all clear what kind of evidence would suffice to falsify this account. The presence of alternations mapping 


The phonological account predicts that speakers would produce $W'$, even if, contrary to the perceptual account, they could reliably perceive $W$. This is schematized below:

\ex Perceptual (non)-effects on loanword adaptation: 
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
a. & Perfect perception: & /W/ $\rightarrow$ [W']
b. & Lossy perception:   & /W'/ $\rightarrow$ [W']
\end{tabular} \xe

The same falsification issue is characteristic of accounts which suggest adaptation is the result of speakers' difficulty with certain non-native articulatory gestures \citep[e.g.,][]{Ussishkin2003}. 

These alternative accounts are more persasive when the adaptation does not correspond to an alternation in the recipient language. 

Phonology might be said to be active in perceptions of non-native phones or phonemes. 

only telepathy could allow speakers of the recipient language access to $W$ at all. 

do not have access to the faithful $W$

\citep[e.g.,][41]{Hjelmslev1970}
\citet{Werker1984,Polka1994}

It could even reflect speakers' knowledge of static generalizations about the native lexicon, divorced from their knowledge of alternation phonology. 

interpretation of orthographic conventions, perceptual biases, and/or motor
programs imposed by knowledge of L, or even a special grammatical
device for loanword adaptation. I am entirely sympathetic to these
models. But it is possible that W is perceived faithfully and is set
up as a UR, and the relation of W to W' in the speech of speakers of L
in contact with the source language corresponds to a synchronic
process in L.

However, Hooper does grant a type of phonotactic constraint on underlying forms. She claims that these constraints are all delimited in terms of surface syllablification. For instance, in a language which only has CV syllables, there is a condition requires syllable boundaries on either side of any CV sequence (ibid., p. 100).

\chapter{Morpheme structure constraints in generative grammar}

The first part of this dissertation concerns the empirical substance of the theory of \textsc{Morpheme Structure Constraints} (MSCs), that is, language-specific constraints on the underlying forms of morphs.
Evidence is presented to support the claim that such constraints are solely derived by other components of grammar, and do not have an independent ontology.

The first section of this chapter outlines a brief history of Morpheme Structure constraints. 
The following section draws upon this material to present the above claim as a null hypothesis, and presents conditions for falsifying it.
The final section outlines the remainder of Part I (chapters 2--4), which provide empirical evidence in support of the null hypothesis.

\section{A brief history of MSCs}

As is so often true in the history of science 
the long history of MSCs does not yield itself ``linearization''. 
Theoretical problems at one point in history are often ignored by subsequent and often incommensurate developments, only to find a satisfying resolution at a much later date \citep[e.g.,][41, 47]{Feyerabend1975}. 
Therefore, I have sorted developments in the theory of MSCs into major periods in the theory of phonology: structuralism, early generativism, autosegmental phonology, classic Optimality Theory, and recent developments. Despite this, such categorization strikes me as artificial, so I have attempted to provide full cross-references.

\subsection{Structuralism}

The primary concern of structuralist phonemic theory is to account for the surface (allophonic) forms of sequences of phonemes according to the context in which the phonemes are found. 

Early on, it was noted that allophony provides no evidence for 

An early step was to note 

\subsubsection{Morpheme boundaries in phonology}

\subsubsection{The morph as constraint domain}

A corrolary of this hypothesis is that the phoneme sequences found within morphs may be distinct from those which span multiple morphs. 

This was apparent to structuralists 

the phonologists 
This is apparent from 
a discussion of constraints on vowel sequences in Mixteco given by \citet{Pike1947b}.
It is apparent that \citeauthor{Pike1947b}'s constraints on vowel sequences are not intended to hold across morph boundaries, 

according to the phonological analysis of a Mixteco text published a few years earlier \citep{Pike1944}.

\citet[][166]{Pike1947b} affirms that the morpheme is ``marked'' by the violation of morpheme-internal sequence restrictions, an idea further developed by \citet{Harris1955} as a morpheme discovery routine.

If, on the other hand, we interpret the set of sequence structure rules as a statement of constraints on systematic phoneme sequences, then this set provides a characterization of the set of `possible' morphemes of Russian. This fact is clear if, as is quite natural, we regard a `possible'  morpheme as a form which may or may not occur in the lexicon, but whose phonological structure violates no sequence structure rule (and of course, no segment structure rule) of the language. \citep[][401]{Stanley1967}

To specify more exactly...which clusters can actually occur, and where, would require paraphrase of a subset of the morphophonemic rules, since the `possible clusters' in Papago, and their distributions, are automatically specified by a number of very general, independently motivated rules which impose a phonetic interpretation upon the morphophonemic representation. \citep[][297]{Hale1965}

\begin{quotation}
...we are forced to incorporate into every complete generative grammar a characterization of the distinction between admissible and inadmissible segment sequences. The fact effectively cuts the ground out from under the recent suggestion that generative grammars be supplemented with special phonological grammars, since the sole purpose of phonological grammars is to characterize the distinction between admissible and inadmissible segment sequences. \citep[][61-62]{Halle1962}

Cast in somewhat disparate theoretical terms,

\citet[][]{Postal1968} concludes, after a lengthy discussion of morpheme structure in Mohawk, that ``the restrictions on phoneme combination are completely a function of the grammar and morphophonemic rules'' (p. 212) and that ``an independent phonotactics...is in all cases useless and redundant in its entirety. It describes or accounts for not one fact which is not accounted for without it'' (p. 214).

This exact case is found in Toba Batak. In this language, contrastively voiced /b, d, g/ occur in onset position, but never morph-finally \citep[][478]{Hayes1986}. As \citeauthor{Hayes2008} notes in a later discussion of these facts, one could posit a process of devoicing in this language, but it would be computationally inert: ``there is no reason to set up any underlying form in Toba Batak that would qualify.'' \citep[][63]{Hayes2008b}.

\citet{Ernestus2003}

Note that 

It seems obvious, though, that whatever speakers are doing in these experiments cannot be assumed to be the same as the process used during first language acquisition if only because the speakers are college-aged and college-aged humans do not in general have first language-like learning abilities due to well-known but poorly understood neurological changes during adolescence. 
Even the most determined adults are unable to approach the language-learning abilities of infants.
This directly implicates a very different task model than the one tacitly assumed \citep{Schutze2005}.

The failure of the Structuralist phonology to account for facts of morpheme structure follows from another pathology inherent to the Structuralist worldview: the undo exclusion of neutralization in phonology.

\section{The reality of inflectional gaps}

Comparing the counts of the preterite and non-preterite forms of \emph{undergo} and \emph{forgo} in both corpora with the Fisher exact test demonstrates that the non-usage of a preterite of \emph{forgo} is unlikely to be accidental (BNC: $p = 3.4$\textsc{e}-31, COCA: $p = 1.7$\textsc{e}-186). This is even true of \emph{sightsee}, which occurs with low frequency as a verb (BNC: $p = 0.0227$).

Surveys of inflectional gaps can be fonud in 

as surveyed in \citealt{Fanselow2002}, \citealt{Rice2009b}, and \citealt{Baerman2010b}. 

A characteristic of the traditional split between derivational morphology and inflectional morphology is 

As \citet{Marantz1997b} notes, there are many cases of productive category-changing morphology. In English the suffix \emph{-ness} productively forms abstract adjectives from nouns, and the suffix \emph{-ōs-} plays a similar productive role in Latin:

There is by now a lengthy literature investigating the phonotactic component of speaker's knowledge of language, and the degree to which such knowledge reflects phonological and/or lexical facts. 

I will argue that a number of studies have underestimated the role of independently-motivated phonological phenomena to ultimately account for such facts.

Why simplicity in the model, when there is at least some precedent for MSCs? 

We might appeal to the importance of constructing a more simle model when possible,

if all ideas are primitive, simple, and so on, there is no formal system construction at all \citep{Goodman1943}.

\subsubsection{Duplication and conspiracy}

\citet[][401]{Stanley1967}

Another major trade-off-, discussed by \citet[][?]{Harms1968}, is between rule and lexical economy; one can imagine models with both aspects.

conspiracy

\citet[][]{Shibatani1973} 

\citet[][310f.]{Clayton1976} also claims that ther is no evidnece that MSCs can diachronically change without changes in the narrow phonology.

A key point, made by \citet[][301]{Clayton1976} with respect to MSCs, is that duplication amounts to claim that ``the two statements represent independent phenomena''. 


\subsubsection{Disjunction}

\subsubsection{Computational inertness} 

\begin{quotation}
Even if we, as linguists, find some generalizations in our description of the lexicon, there is no reason to posit these generalizations as part of the speaker's knowledge of their language, since they are computational inert and thus irrelevant to the input-output mappings that grammar is responsible for. \citep[][18-19]{PE}
\end{quotation}

\subsubsection{Falsifiability}          % wordlikeness 

Also in Chapter 3, I will provide explicit quantitative evidence that highly statistically reliable generalizations identified by linguists may play no role in wordlikeness tasks. This does not eliminate the possibility that some constraints, either stated on the 

but any study that uses statistics about the structure of underlying forms may be modeling a generalization that has no synchronic status at all.

outside the extension of a speaker's phonology \citep[][3]{Goldsmith1995}.

Generative phonologies are not constrained to be \emph{bijective},
%\footnote{Formally, a function $f(X) \rightarrow Y$ is bijective if only if $\forall y \in Y . \exists! x \in X . y = f(x)$.}

leaving the underlying form of a morph often underdetermined even when the URs of roots are known. For instance, the surface form \emph{frōns} in Latin could mean either `forehead', from /front-s/ (cf. gen.sg. \emph{frontis}) or `leaf', from /frond-s/ (cf. gen.sg. \emph{frondis}). From the surface form alone, there is no way to decide if an [ns] is from /nts/, /nds/, or perhaps /ns/ (though see \citealt{Gorman2011b}). Countless other examples of this type could easily be adduced.

%One might admit some indeterminacy in underlying form; for instance, giving \emph{frōns} a tentative UR /fronT-s/, where /T/ is an archiphoneme representing /t, d/. 
%Even determining such degenerate URs from surface forms is itself not guaranteed to be efficiently computable \citep{Barton1987}, casting doubt on the plausibility of ``inverted phonology'' as the appropriate cognitive model \citep[see][530 for discussion]{Anderson1988}.

\footnote{A function $f: X \Rightarrow Y$ is \emph{injective} if and only if $\forall x \in X . \forall x' \in X . \left[f(x) = f(x')\right] \rightarrow \left[x = x'\right]$, and \emph{bijective} if and only if $\forall y \in Y , \exists x \in X . f(x) = y \wedge \left[\forall x' \in X . \left[f(x') = y \right] \rightarrow \left[x' = x\right] \right]$ \citep[][251]{Partee1990}.}

\subsection{Outline}

\section{A brief history of the MSC}

A brief note on the organization of this section: the subsections below correspond to chronologically ordered theoretical periods, but within each period, no attempt has been made to respect chronology.

\subsection{The structuralist MSC}

\subsubsection{Constraints on phoneme sequences}
% Vogt, Fischer-Jorgensen

\begin{quotation}
\ldots the fact that some [clusters--KG] are not found must be due to accidental gaps in the inventory of signs, and cannot be explained by structural laws of the language. \citep[][]{Fischer-Jorgensen1952}
\end{quotation}

\noindent
Hans \citeauthor{Vogt1954} makes a similar observation in his study of Georgian clusters

\begin{quotation}
Although my material is drawn from a fairly extensive corpus---all accessible dictionaries and vocabularies, printed texts of tens of thousands of pages as well as ordinary speech---there is every reason to believe, as experience has shown, that additional material would yield new clusters. The material will never be complete. It will always contain accidental gaps \ldots partly because some clusters by pure chance do not occur in the vocabulary. \citep[][30]{Vogt1954}
\end{quotation}

\subsubsection{The morph in phonology}
% German, Russian
% Bloomfield, Jakobson

A major result of the American structuralists was the finding that generalizations which hold of the sound sequences found in underlying forms may not hold across morpheme boundaries. If this is correct, then there must be some sense in which phonology is sensitive to the presence of morpheme boundaries. In his history of phonology, \citet[][267]{Anderson1985} credits this innovation to \citet{Bloomfield1930}, who proposes that a problem in the phonemic analysis of German can be resolved by allowing for allophony to make reference to morpheme boundaries. \citeauthor{Bloomfield1930} notes that [ç] and [x] can be cast as allophones, despite the existence of apparent minimal pairs like \emph{Kuchen} [ku\lm xən] `cake' $\sim$ \emph{Kuhchen} [ku\lm çən] `cow-let'. \citeauthor{Bloomfield1930}'s claim is that these words differ not just in their medial consonsant but also that the latter is a compound, marked with the diminutive \emph{-chen} (cf. \emph{Kuh} `cow'). Under the assumption that [x] occurs in this position (before a back vowel) only when this preceding vowel belongs to the same word or morpheme, [ç] and [x] can be cast as allophones of the same phoneme (likely /ç/, the basic variant).

While \citeauthor{Bloomfield1930} is known for introducing morphemic structure into phonology, a member of the Prague circle developed an arguably more sophisticated approach only two years later. 

%While \citeauthor{Bloomfield1930} is known for introducing morphemic structure into phonology, a member of the Prague circle developed an arguably more sophisticated approach only two years later. 
\citet{Jakobson1932} attributes a number of phonological properites of the Russian imperative to morpheme juncture. The vast majority of Russian infinitives consist of the stem followed by a theme vowel and /t\pal/. The reflexive is marked wih a final /-sə/ which feeds a general process of regressive voicing assimilation. In the reflexive infinitive, /\ldots t\pal-s\ldots/ is realized [ts], with no palatalization. However, palatalization of a stem-final labial or coronal---including /t\pal/, as in (\nextx c)---is preserved in the reflexive imperative.
\footnote{I have taken a number of liberties with \citeauthor{Jakobson1932}'s presentation of the data, which uses a highly abstract phonemic transcription. 
The transcriptions used here are based on the speech of Lev Blumenfeld.}

\ex Russian reflexives \citep[after][]{Jakobson1932}: \\
\begin{tabular}{l l l l} %\toprule
   &  infinitive      & imperative \\ %\midrule
a. & [slav\pal itsə]  & [slaf\pal s\pal ə]  & `be glorious'    \\
   & [upram\pal itsə] & [upram\pal s\pal ə] & `be stubborn'    \\
b. & [kras\pal itsə]  & [kras\pal s\pal ə]  & `put on makeup'  \\
   & [ʒar\pal itsə]   & [ʒar\pal s\pal ə]   & `roast'          \\
c. & [zəbytsə]        & [zəbut\pal s\pal ə] & `forget' \\ %\bottomrule
%   & ab\'utsa      & ab\'ujsa     & `put on shoes'   \\
\end{tabular} \xe

\noindent
The forms in (\lastx c) have different outcomes for their /t\pal-s/ clusters. \citeauthor{Jakobson1932} proposes that the preservation of palatalization is a special property of the imperative. %A few years later, \citet{Trnka1936}, another member of the Prague Circle, makes the connection between \citeauthor{Jakobson1932}'s hypothesis and phonotactic generalizations.

\bibliography{/Users/kgorman/Documents/Other/kgorman.bib}
\end{document}

Both (\lastx c) forms contain a /t\pal-s/ juncture, though palatalization is only preserved in the imperative. \citeauthor{Jakobson1932} proposes that the phonology treats them differently: the imperative does not undergo loss of palatalization. A few years later, \citet{Trnka1936}, another member of the Prague Circle, makes the connection between \citeauthor{Jakobson1932}'s hypothesis and phonotactic generalizations.
 
\subsubsection{The morpheme structure constraint}
% Mixteco
% Pike 

A natural consequence of this view is that generalizations about sound sequences found within morphemes are necessarily different within and across morpheme boundaries, and \citet{Pike1947b} argues that the distributional analysis of sound sequences must take morphology into account. \citeauthor{Pike1947b} discusses limitations on possible vowel sequences in Mixteco monomorphs, but none of these generalizations hold across morpheme boundaries, at least according to the phonological analysis of a short Mixteco text in one of \citeauthor{Pike1944}'s earlier papers.

d. & *{C}i{C}e & [tenìkeet\`ə] & `and went away'      \\ 
\end{tabular} \xe

\noindent
\citet[][166]{Pike1947b} affirms that the morpheme is ``marked'' by the violation of morpheme-internal sequence restrictions, an idea further developed by \citet{Harris1955} as a morpheme discovery routine.

If, on the other hand, we interpret the set of sequence structure rules as a statement of constraints on systematic phoneme sequences, then this set provides a characterization of the set of `possible' morphemes of Russian. This fact is clear if, as is quite natural, we regard a `possible'  morpheme as a form which may or may not occur in the lexicon, but whose phonological structure violates no sequence structure rule (and of course, no segment structure rule) of the language. \citep[][401]{Stanley1967}
\end{quotation}

\subsubsection{Surface constraints}

\citeauthor{Hale1965}

\begin{quotation}
To specify more exactly...which clusters can actually occur, and where, would require paraphrase of a subset of the morphophonemic rules, since the `possible clusters' in Papago, and their distributions, are automatically specified by a number of very general, independently motivated rules which impose a phonetic interpretation upon the morphophonemic representation. \citep[][297]{Hale1965}
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
...we are forced to incorporate into every complete generative grammar a characterization of the distinction between admissible and inadmissible segment sequences. The fact effectively cuts the ground out from under the recent suggestion that generative grammars be supplemented with special phonological grammars, since the sole purpose of phonological grammars is to characterize the distinction between admissible and inadmissible segment sequences. \citep[][61-62]{Halle1962}
\end{quotation}

Cast in somewhat disparate theoretical terms,

\citet[][]{Postal1968} concludes, after a lengthy discussion of morpheme structure in Mohawk, that ``the restrictions on phoneme combination are completely a function of the grammar and morphophonemic rules'' (p. 212) and that ``an independent phonotactics...is in all cases useless and redundant in its entirety. It describes or accounts for not one fact which is not accounted for without it'' (p. 214).

The data presently available to us suggests that is is indeed the case that all the types of rule interaction sketched above---feeding, counterfeeding, bleeding, and counterbleeding---are required both for the application of separate rules and also \emph{for the multiple applications of a single rule}. \citep[][327, emphasis mine]{Kenstowicz1979}

\citet{Gambell2005}:
if the infant extracts allophonic cues from the linguistic data, it seems...that she must have extracted a set of words to begin with. Hence, the assumptions and mechanisms required for the successful application of articulatory cues remain somewhat unclear.

\subsubsection{Inventory gaps}

\subsubsection{Accidental gaps}

practically a correlate of arbitrariness

\citet[][]{Fischer-Jorgensen1952} and \citet{Vogt1954}

\citet[94]{Hooper1973} claims that ``in languages that allow relatively complex consonant clusters, the occurring clusters represent only a small percentage of all theoretically possible consonant clusters.'' 

\begin{quotation}
In describing and explaining the phonotatic patterns in any language, phonologists recognize a distinction between accidental and systematic gaps in the lexcion. In practice, this distinction has often been applied in an intuitive and \emph{post-hoc} fashion. A gap is taken to be systematic if it belongs to a natural class of examples according to the current theory of the investigator. Otherwise, it is viewed as accidental. \citep[][180]{Frisch2004}
\end{quotation}

(and unfortunately, the approach taken by \citeauthor{Frisch2004}).

Surely it is the case that if there were no more phonological constraints, there would be no

It must be stressed that under current assumptions, this is independent of whether predictable prosodic representations (particularly coda and onset identity) are part of the memorized underlying representation \citep[e.g.,][]{Vaux2003}.
