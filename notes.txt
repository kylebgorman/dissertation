Imagine a word $W$ from some donor language borrowed into a recipient language as $W'$. For the sake of simplicity, I further assume speakers of both languages are monolingual and that the contact is not in any way mediated by writing. There are many possible explanations for a nonvacuous function mapping $W$ to $W'$. 

In many cases, $W$ is the target of one or more synchronic processes in the source language and $W'$ is the expected outcome. These synchronic processes can give rise to the adaptation under the assumption that $W$ is perceived faithfully by speakers of the recipient language, and thus set up as the UR for the loanword. Naturally, the application of the synchronic processes will produce outputs of $W'$. Unless new alternations are introduced, speakers who are not in contact with the donor language will treat $W'$ as the UR. Any instance of this account can be falsified by showing that the synchronic processes used to characterize the adaptation are incorrect characterizations of the recipient language.

In such a case, the relation of $W$ to $W'$ might instead represent lossy perception of $W$ as $W'$ by speakers of the recipient language \citep[e.g.,][]{Halle1998b,Dupoux1999,Peperkamp2008}, in which case the speakers of the recipient language have no access to $W'$. However, it is not at all clear what kind of evidence would suffice to falsify this account. The presence of alternations mapping 



The phonological account predicts that speakers would produce $W'$, even if, contrary to the perceptual account, they could reliably perceive $W$. This is schematized below:

\ex Perceptual (non)-effects on loanword adaptation: 
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
a. & Perfect perception: & /W/ $\rightarrow$ [W']
b. & Lossy perception:   & /W'/ $\rightarrow$ [W']
\end{tabular} \xe

The same falsification issue is characteristic of accounts which suggest adaptation is the result of speakers' difficulty with certain non-native articulatory gestures \citep[e.g.,][]{Ussishkin2003}. 




These alternative accounts are more persasive when the adaptation does not correspond to an alternation in the recipient language. 



Phonology might be said to be active in perceptions of non-native phones or phonemes.

It could even reflect speakers' knowledge of static generalizations about the native lexicon, divorced from their knowledge of alternation phonology. 


It may also reflect an semi-automonous module of grammar dedicated solely to loanword

interpretation of orthographic conventions, perceptual biases, and/or motor
programs imposed by knowledge of L, or even a special grammatical
device for loanword adaptation. I am entirely sympathetic to these
models. But it is possible that W is perceived faithfully and is set
up as a UR, and the relation of W to W' in the speech of speakers of L
in contact with the source language corresponds to a synchronic
process in L.

Hooper concurs.

However, Hooepr does grant a type of phonotactic constraint on underlying forms. She claims that these constraints are all delimited in terms of surface syllablification. For instance, in a language which only has CV syllables, there is a condition requires syllable boundaries on either side of any CV sequence (ibid., p. 100). 

this is a very surfacey

In evaluating this claim, we should ask whether this has any role to play in the grammar at all.
