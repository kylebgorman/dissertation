Other things remain unresolvable: only theory-internal considerations can decide what the final segment of the Turkish \emph{čilek} `strawberry' is, or what the representation of [sek]-[seɣɘ] `blind' in Catalan \citep[7]{PE}.
%Final stops are subject to devoicing, so it might be underlying /G/, and it deletes intervocalically (e.g., \emph{čilei}). 

in infants \citep{Mattys2001a} and adults \citep{Brown1956,Hay2004a,McQueen1998b}. Models of word segmentation using this heuristic exist \citep[e.g.,][]{Norris1997}, but they operate on different inputs and outputs than any model of nonce word well-formedness. This is not a duplication per se, because wordlikeness cannot be reduced to segmentation: [bznk] is no more possible as a English phrase than it is as an English word. 

This statistical test is so named because it is similar to the chi-square test over contingency tables, the Fisher test computes an exact $p$-value where as the chi-square test depends on an approximation inappropriate for small samples.

CHAPTER 1:

- discuss Silverman, Benua, and Kiparsky on *ū and short-a

CHAPTER 4:

- which of "many" authors cited?
- "knowledge" vs. "regularity": which is "known"?
- why am I using stringent criteria? 
- +- obs vs. +- son
- why only "some" hetero-voiced clusters?
- free/freely, full/fully
- discuss numbers more about no exceptions
- p44 discussion should come earlier
- f1 makes sense? probably no
- clarify "this variant", "this predictor"
- source of exceptions? 
- discussion of proper names (Trubetzkoy)
- clarify "prob of all accidental gaps"
- "likely" to be accidental gaps
