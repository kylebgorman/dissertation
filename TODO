\ldots{}certain regularities are observed within lexical items as well as across certain boundaries---the rule governing voicing of obstruent sequences in Russian, for example---and to avoid duplication of such rules it is necessary to regard them not as redundancy rules but as phonological rules that also happen to apply internally to a lexical item\ldots{}in the case of duplication of redundancy rules and P rules, only the P rules should be written. \citep[382]{SPE}

- footnote on Chao, Sapir, Twadell, Harris, Bloomfield...

CHAPTER 4:

- which of "many" authors cited?
- "knowledge" vs. "regularity": which is "known"?
- why am I using stringent criteria? 
- +- obs vs. +- son
- why only "some" hetero-voiced clusters?
- free/freely, full/fully
- discuss numbers more about no exceptions
- p44 discussion should come earlier
- f1 makes sense? probably no
- clarify "this variant", "this predictor"
- source of exceptions? 
- discussion of proper names (Trubetzkoy)
- clarify "prob of all accidental gaps"
