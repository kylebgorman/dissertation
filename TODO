Chapter 1:

- Include this: 

\begin{quote}
\ldots{}certain regularities are observed within lexical items as well as across certain boundaries---the rule governing voicing of obstruent sequences in Russian, for example---and to avoid duplication of such rules it is necessary to regard them not as redundancy rules but as phonological rules that also happen to apply internally to a lexical item\ldots{}in the case of duplication of redundancy rules and P rules, only the P rules should be written. \citep[382]{SPE}
\end{quote}

- Example of extensions to loanwords

- Clarify Russian details
- Rather, the real puzzle is to determine which generalizations are incorporated.
- Talk about what it means to be a "process" vs. not
