Edit

What a theory of phonotactics should account for is itself contentious. 
It should account for contrasts 
There are also numerous things the theory need not, and should not, account for. The phonotactic system does not need to say anything about any contrast between actual words like \emph{brick} and possible, but non-existent words like \emph{blick}. That contrast derives from the fact that \emph{brick} has a denotation, whereas \emph{blick} does not, and a phonotactic model that distinguishes between the two is on the wrong track. 

such models have been constructed, but they operate on different inputs and outputs than any model of nonce word well-formedness.

This statistical test is so named because it is similar to the chi-square test over contingency tables, the Fisher test computes an exact $p$-value where as the chi-square test depends on an approximation inappropriate for small samples.

1. What wordlikeness might not be
    1. gradience in judgements
        gradience in other tasks
        not an inherent property of judgements, though 
    2. armstrong et al.
        While this study is not concerned with language, the findings are very much relevant to grammatical theory, though not widely discussed by linguists (though see Schutze, Yang).
