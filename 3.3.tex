%Reduplicate and replace the reduplicant-initial vowel with [a]
this ludling, while not in present in Turkish, is found in Tuvan.

The failure of disharmonic stems to ``reharmonize'' in language games is not limited to this particular artificial Turkish langauge game, either: Tuvan disharmonic roots also fail to disharmonize \citep{Harrison2001}, and, as \citeauthor{Harrison2001} notes, also for a different language game in Finnish \citep{Campbell1986}. 

\citet{Suomi1997} and \citet{Vroomen1998} find that Finnish adults
% use harmony to segment

\citet{Kabak2010} % turksih adults use harmony to segment

\citet{Kampen2008} % Turkish L1 (german l2) speakers segment using harmony, but their L1 German colleagues do not

%We might suggest methods not based only on statistical significance, but rather substantive computational properties of the linguistic objects in question \citep[e.g.,][]{Yang2005a}.
