This has an ad hoc nature to it; 
There are two senses in which this objection is ad hoc. 
First, \citeauthor{Becker2011} appeal to no particular theory of the naturalness of processes or static constraints which excludes \textsc{Labial Attraction}. 
Secondly, this appears to be a minority view: \textsc{Labial Attraction} was considered a true generalization by early specialists
\citep[e.g.,][]{Lees1966a}, and despite \citeauthor{Zimmer1969}'s suggestive psycholinguistic results, reviewed above, it also been treated as a plausible constraint by later theorists \citep[e.g.,][]{NiChiosain1993,Ito1993,Ito1995a,Zuraw2000}.
Further, there is a real danger that if the label ``unnatural'' 
%Labial Attraction} 
describes an impossible structural change or structural description, that one will fail to account for earlier forms of Turkish or sound changes therein.

%It is important to note that the nature of the \emph{blick}/\emph{bnick} contrast is no longer a mystery. 
%Generative phonological theory at the time of \emph{SPE} lacked the representational vocabulary to directly distinguish between word-initial /bn/, which is disallowed, and /bn/ as a licit syllable contact cluster (e.g., \emph{o}[b.n]\emph{oxious}), a point first made by \citep{Hooper1973}. It is not the introduction of prosodic primitives into generative phonology that explains the contrast between \emph{blick} and \emph{bnick}, though, but rather the principle that surface forms must be syllabified \citep[e.g.,][63f.]{Kiparsky1982b} which \emph{bnick} fails. If, as is standardly assumed, phonology repairs unsyllabifiable outputs \citep[e.g.][]{Ito1989a,Noske1992}, then \emph{bnick} is an impossible output, doomed to be modified (perhaps to \emph{nick}; \citealt[][19f.]{Wolf2009}), and /bnɪk/ is an impossible UR by Stampean occultation. 

%\footnote{I note a potential problem with this account: \citet{Davidson2005,Davidson2006a} argue that this ``excrescent'' schwa is distinct from the both in acoustics and articulation from ``lexical schwa'': English speakers' [z${^\textrm{ə}}$k] is more similar to \emph{scum} than \emph{succumb}.}

%\noindent A nuanced version of this alternative hypothesis would recognize that there may be other necessary conditions. Any explicit theory of static constraints will have to impose formal restrictions on possible co-occurrence restrictions. The set of possible constraints must respect results in formal learning theory, and may also be constrained by markedness considerations, for example.

%A further widespread assumption is that static co-occurrence restrictions validated statistically will be reflected by wordlikeness judgements. This assumption is so deeply entrenched that a number of recent studies of phonotactic learning forgo wordlikeness judgements altogether and instead model the lexical statistics themselves (e.g., \citealt{Coetzee2008a} and \citealt{Anttila2008} on Muna and Arabic, \citealt[][385]{Hayes2008a} on Shona and Wargamay, \citealt{Brown2010} on Gitksan). 

%Since the null hypothesis does not countenance statistical significance as evidence for the synchronic reality of a static lexical pattern, such patterns do not adjudicate between the null hypothesis and the alternative, and another source of evidence is needed. In the remainder of Part I, I turn to data from wordlikeness judgement tasks for these purposes. 

%In a wordlikeness task, a speaker is presented with nonce words and asked to report such intuitions about the ``possibility'' of a word. 
%The alternative hypothesis, then, is that a statistically reliable co-occurrence restriction will be reflected in native speakers' wordlikeness judgements. 
%The data below, drawn from Turkish, shows that 

%This chapter takes the argument one step farther by showing a contrast between static and derived constraints on URs in Turkish. Whereas the derived constraint has a robust effect on native speakers' wordlikeness judgements, the static constraint, which is equally statistically valid, has no effect on these judgements. Anticipating the conclusion, the simplest explanation for the non-effect of this static constraint on wordlikeness judgements is that speakers do not internalize static co-occurrence restrictions at all.
