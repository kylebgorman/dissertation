A defect of current grammatical acounts of phonotactics is that they render simple up-or-down- decisions concerning well-formedness and cannot account for gradient judgements. But when judgements are elicited in a controlled fashion from speakers, they always emerge as gradient, including all intermediate values. \citep[][371]{Shademan2006}

In the particular domain of phonotactics gradient intuitions are pervasive: they have been found in every experiment that allowed participants to rate forms on a scale\ldots{}we consider the ability to model gradient intuitions to be an important criterion for evaluating phonotactic models. \citep[][382]{Hayes2008a}

%Gradient intuition can be found even among forms that satisfy the categorical phonotactics of the language, but contain rare sequences\ldots{}

When native speakers are asked to judge made-up (nonce) words, their intuitions are rarely all-or-nothing. In the usual case, novel items fall along a gradient cline of acceptability. \citep[][9]{Albright2009a}
