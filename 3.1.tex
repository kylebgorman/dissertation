\section{Turkish vowel sequence structure constraints}

%\citet{Lees1966a,Lees1966b} 
\citet{Lees1966b,Lees1966a} 
proposes three constraints on Turkish vowel sequences which have been the focus of many subsequent studies. In this section, these constraints are formalized, and where possible, related to phonological alternations in Turkish and to evidence that speakers have internalized these restrictions. The following feature specification for the Turkish vowels is assumed throughout.

\begin{example}
Turkish vowel features:

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c}
                       & \multicolumn{2}{c}{[$-$\textsc{Back}]} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{[$+$\textsc{Back}]} \\
                       & [$-$\textsc{Round}] & [$+$\textsc{Round}] & [$-$\textsc{Round}] & [$+$\textsc{Round}] \\ \midrule
\buf[$+$\textsc{High}] & {i} & {ü} [y] & {ı} [ɯ] & {u} \\
\buf[$-$\textsc{High}] & {e} & {ö} [ø] & {a} [ɑ] & {o} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{example}
