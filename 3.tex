\chapter{Static and derived phonotactic constraints in Turkish} 
\label{turkish}

%This chapter attempts to derive which phonotactic judgemetns are internalized by 

\citet{Chomsky1965} argue that speakers internalize not only generalizations governing phonological alternations in their language, but also about the shapes of possible words in their language. It is certainly possible to imagine that speakers would not bother at all. \citet[][320]{Zimmer1969} claims these generalizations ``have no observable consequences in the course of the normal use of the language'' and a similar sentiment is echoed more recently by \citeauthor{PE}:

\begin{quote}
Even if we, as linguists, find some generalizations in our description of the lexicon, there is no reason to posit these generalizations as part of the speaker's knowledge of their language, since they are computationally inert and thus irrelevant to the input-output mapping that the grammar is responsible for. \citep[][18]{PE}
\end{quote}

This is a principled null hypothesis, but one which can be quickly rejected. \citeauthor{Chomsky1965} point to robust contrasts between equally unattested items like *\emph{blick}, which is recognized by speakers a possible word of English, and *\emph{bnick}, which is not.\footnote{Any readers who are skeptical that \citeauthor{Chomsky1965}'s intuitions generalize will find support for their claim in the wordlikeness judgement data reported in Appendix \ref{albright}.}
%As a quick validation of this claim, consider the results reported by \citet{Albright2007} and discussed in the previous chapter. English speakers asked to rate non-words on a scale from 1-7, where 7 indicates ``most like English'', favor non-words [blʌs, blɑd] (average scores 4.67 and 5.13) over [bnʌs, bnɑd] (average scores 2.06, 2.00).
This preference must be regarded as a learned behavior, since many languages permit  \emph{bn} onsets (e.g., Moroccan Arabic \emph{bni} `building', \emph{bnat} `daughters', \emph{bniqa} `closet'). It is also possible to show speakers access this knowledge not just in wordlikeness judgement tasks but also in naturalistic and quotidien tasks like segmenting spontaneous speech into words, as \citet{McQueen1998} and \citet{Mattys2001b} argue for adult and infant subjects, respectively.

\citeauthor{Chomsky1965} were not the first to take an interest in characterizing the lexicon, which was also a major concern for the scholars of the Copenhagen school. In two sophisticated studies dealing with possible and impossible onsets in Georgian, \citet{Fischer-Jorgensen1952} and \citet{Vogt1954} recognize the inherent difficulty of distinguishing between structural and accidental phonotactic gaps in the lexicon on the basis of statistical criteria alone. What distinguishes the early generativist approach to phonotactics is the mentalistic concern with what generalizations speakers have internalized. By grounding the study of phonotactics in the minds of speakers, it is possible to give a precise definition to the previously vague notions; an accidental phonotactic gap is simply one which speakers do not attend to or internalize. Yet few studies of phonotactics are explicitly concerned with what speakers have internalized, despite the increasing sophistication of the phonological representations used. In a seminal paper, \citet{McCarthy1988} uses a simple statistical technique, a chi-square test, in an attempt to validate a generalization about Arabic root consonant co-occurrence faces originally due to \citet{Greenberg1950}. While this particular generalization was ultimately also evaluated using a wordlikeness task \citep{Frisch2004}, there is now an extensive literature in which phonotactic knowledge is inferred directly from lexical statistics, with no psycholinguistic component of any kind \citep[e.g.,][]{Mester1988,Padgett1992,Padgett1995,Berkley1994b,Berkley1994a,Berkley2000,Buckley1997,MacEachern1999,Kinney2005,Kawahara2006,Martin2007,Martin2011,Pozdniakov2007,Anttila2008,Coetzee2008a,Dmitrieva2008a,Dmitrieva2008b,Graff2011}. The (usually tacit) assumption of most of this work is made explicit by \citet{Brown2010} in his study of consonant cluster co-occurrence restrictions in Gitksan: any statistically significant pattern in the lexicon is one that is internalized by speakers. 

\begin{quote}
\ldots{}the patterns outlined above are statististically significant. Given this, it stands that these sound patterns should be explained by some linguistic mechanism. \citep[][48]{Brown2010}
\end{quote}

In the loanword adaptation literature, it has recently been recognized that not all statistically reliable generalizations about the native lexicon take part in nativization of borrowings \citep[e.g.,][]{Ito1995a,Ito1995b,Ussishkin2003}. In this chapter, data from Turkish is used to show that a widely reported, statistically reliable phonotactic generalization (\textsc{Labial Attraction}) has no effect on wordlikeness judgements. This undermines the widespread use of statistic criteria to determine which of the vast number of the overlapping, competing phonotactic generalizations are internalized by speakers and which are ignored. Comparison of \textsc{Labial Attraction} to related constraints in Turkish suggests a novel necessary condition for identifying psychologically real phonotactic constraints: namely, speakers attend to phonotactic generalizations only when they are derived from phonological processes (including syllabification).

There are a number of precedents for 

This hypothesis was anticipated by \cite[][283]{Anderson1974}.

\begin{quote}
It would be a result of the greatest interest if it were to turn out that every intramorphemic regularity was necessarily reflected in an alternation, and thus in a rule; but this position cannot seriously be maintained. \citep[][283]{Anderson1974}
\end{quote}



This hypothesis is not ahdered to by early research on sequence structure constraints \citep[e.g.,][]{SPR,Chomsky1965,SPE,Stanley1967}. 


Work in this vein sought to use sequence structure constraints to compress the lexicon as much as possible 


This work has a second interest, namely in ``compressing'' the lexicon as much as possible,

% motivations for the development of a theory of static co-occurrence restrictions as developed by \citet{SPR}, \citet{Stanley1967} and others is to account for speakers' abilities to distinguish between accidental and structural gaps. \citet{Chomsky1965} propose that a theory of phonology must account for speakers' abilities to distinguish between accidental and structural gaps in their language, citing a contrast between \emph{blick}, which is judged to be a possible but unattested word of English, and \emph{bnick}, which is judged to be impossible. \emph{SPE} (p.~3810f.) places this contrast in a system of a system of sequence structure rules that also are used to eliminate lexical redundancy. In the phonological theory of the era, there is no process that could generate the \emph{blick} $\sim$ \emph{bnick} contrast or numerous other lexical regularities 

This condition (henceforth, the \textsc{derived} condition) 
On a historical note, this hypothesis is more constrained than what was proposed
such constraints must be derived from phonological processes in the language in question
synchronically motivated phonological processes such as alternation or syllabification.

%It is important to note that the nature of the \emph{blick}/\emph{bnick} contrast is no longer a mystery. 
%Generative phonological theory at the time of \emph{SPE} lacked the representational vocabulary to directly distinguish between word-initial /bn/, which is disallowed, and /bn/ as a licit syllable contact cluster (e.g., \emph{o}[b.n]\emph{oxious}), a point first made by \citep{Hooper1973}. It is not the introduction of prosodic primitives into generative phonology that explains the contrast between \emph{blick} and \emph{bnick}, though, but rather the principle that surface forms must be syllabified \citep[e.g.,][63f.]{Kiparsky1982b} which \emph{bnick} fails. If, as is standardly assumed, phonology repairs unsyllabifiable outputs \citep[e.g.][]{Ito1989a,Noske1992}, then \emph{bnick} is an impossible output, doomed to be modified (perhaps to \emph{nick}; \citealt[][19f.]{Wolf2009}), and /bnɪk/ is an impossible UR by Stampean occultation. 

%\footnote{I note a potential problem with this account: \citet{Davidson2005,Davidson2006a} argue that this ``excrescent'' schwa is distinct from the both in acoustics and articulation from ``lexical schwa'': English speakers' [z${^\textrm{ə}}$k] is more similar to \emph{scum} than \emph{succumb}.}

%This sequence of arguments has already been critiqued in Chapter \ref{1}, where it was shown that prosodic licensing and Stampean occultation places this contrast in core phonology, and that the principles by which speakers recognize impossible words must be stated on surface representations, not underlying representations. Further, \citet[][528f.]{Halle1975} rejects his own principle that lexical entries should be free of all redundancies (see \citealt[][201]{Reiss2003a} and \citealt{Vaux2003} for further discussion). This rejected principle of a redundancy-free lexicon is one of the two principles that motivates Morpheme Structure Constraints; the other is the subject of this and the following chapter.

%\noindent A nuanced version of this alternative hypothesis would recognize that there may be other necessary conditions. Any explicit theory of static constraints will have to impose formal restrictions on possible co-occurrence restrictions. The set of possible constraints must respect results in formal learning theory, and may also be constrained by markedness considerations, for example.

%A further widespread assumption is that static co-occurrence restrictions validated statistically will be reflected by wordlikeness judgements. This assumption is so deeply entrenched that a number of recent studies of phonotactic learning forgo wordlikeness judgements altogether and instead model the lexical statistics themselves (e.g., \citealt{Coetzee2008a} and \citealt{Anttila2008} on Muna and Arabic, \citealt[][385]{Hayes2008a} on Shona and Wargamay, \citealt{Brown2010} on Gitksan). 

%Since the null hypothesis does not countenance statistical significance as evidence for the synchronic reality of a static lexical pattern, such patterns do not adjudicate between the null hypothesis and the alternative, and another source of evidence is needed. In the remainder of Part I, I turn to data from wordlikeness judgement tasks for these purposes. 

%In a wordlikeness task, a speaker is presented with nonce words and asked to report such intuitions about the ``possibility'' of a word. 
%The alternative hypothesis, then, is that a statistically reliable co-occurrence restriction will be reflected in native speakers' wordlikeness judgements. 
%The data below, drawn from Turkish, shows that 

%This chapter takes the argument one step farther by showing a contrast between static and derived constraints on URs in Turkish. Whereas the derived constraint has a robust effect on native speakers' wordlikeness judgements, the static constraint, which is equally statistically valid, has no effect on these judgements. Anticipating the conclusion, the simplest explanation for the non-effect of this static constraint on wordlikeness judgements is that speakers do not internalize static co-occurrence restrictions at all.
