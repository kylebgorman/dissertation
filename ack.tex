So many researchers contribute to any dissertation that to name them all compromises the honor of those most involved. More than anyone else, I owe a debt of gratitude to my advisor, Charles Yang, for his commitment to my work and the principle of explanatory adequacy. My other internal committee members, Gene Buckley, Mark Liberman, and Rolf Noyer, and the faculty at IRCS, are responsible for creating an environment at Penn where this (admittedly contentious) dissertation could be written. Though his name appears nowhere else in this document, it is hard to imagine it could exist without the pioneering work of Bill Labov.

The subject of the first chapter was inspired by the mentoring of Jennifer Cole. Important contributions to this dissertation were made by Stephen Anderson, who graciously agreed to serve on my committee, Michael Wagner, who gave me a goal to work towards, and Morris Halle, who taught me to never apologize.

I would like to thank my fellow students at Penn, but especially my cohort, Toni Cook, Laurel MacKenzie, and Stefanie Brody. Elsewhere, I have been shown a great deal of kindness by so many, but especially Morgan Sonderregger and Maryam Bakht. Daniel Ezra Johnson fearlessly proofread (\emph{proofreaded}?) the entire document. Among non-linguists, my good friend Carly Fisher stands out for her unflagging support. Among parents, mine stand out for having more faith in their son than he could ever merit.
